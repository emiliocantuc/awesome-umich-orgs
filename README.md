# awesome umich orgs
A better way of exploring student organizations from the University of Michigan.

A weekend hack inspired by [@karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy)'s [awesome-movies.life](https://awesome-movies.life). We simply embed the name + description of student orgs and display their nearest neighbors.

Student org data is scraped from [maizepages.umich.edu](https://maizepages.umich.edu/organizations) and embeddings are generated using OpenAI's [text-embedding-ada-002](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) model.
