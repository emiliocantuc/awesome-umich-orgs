Then the Alexander Hamilton Society is the organization for you!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Alexander Hamilton Society (AHS) is an independent, non-partisan, membership organization dedicated to promoting the basic principles and contemporary issues in foreign, economic, and national security policy. We are part of a national network of outstanding students, faculty, and professionals that sponsor events at many major universities. We also provide other opportunities for our members to flourish professionally and personally, and our members span worldwide and are united at basic convictions discussing the United State's role in the world. Our activities include:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Hamiltonian Statecraft</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Every student who applies to be an author will have an opportunity to get published on an issue in international relations and national security on a semesterly basis. Under the guidance of our Editor in Chief, members would receive close mentorship and active feedback on five possible entry formats: research paper, academic essay, Op-Ed, policy proposal, and book review. Additionally, students would have the opportunity to crosslist the publication with the national organization&rsquo;s journal, The Hamiltonian.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Hamiltonian Diplomacy</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Selected AHS members will compete in bisemesterly conferences per year for any of the following: Model UN, Model NATO, Model European Union, and Model Arab League. The delegation team would be led by the Director of Academic Programs, who would assist and coach delegates in successfully representing our Chapter to the national conference.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Speaker events and panels</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The speaker panels/events provide students an understanding of what American leadership has achieved. They address complex global issues from multiple perspectives with a goal to promote critical thinking. Speakers include former Secretaries of State, Secretaries of Defense, Directors of CIA, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Senior Fellows at esteemed think tanks and civil societies in Washington D.C.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>National Programming:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The national charter runs intensive programs for students to educate skills and knowledge for foreign affairs and national security careers. Members of the AHS would have the opportunity to engage with scholars in foreign policy and national security through expert panels, chapter training, professional development, and networking opportunities. These include the National Defense Fellowship run by the AHS and the Ronald Reagan Institute, the Hamilton National Fellowship that provides grants for summer internships in Washington, DC, and book series that provide a wide perspective to foreign affairs, defense, and economic policy.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Wargaming and policy simulations</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The wargames and policy simulations, designed by RAND Corporation, would serve to educate our membership on American grand strategy, defense policy, and budgeting forward engagement. Led by the Director of Policy, wargames and policy simulations would be run on a monthly basis on various formats and various international crisis scenarios to provide a firsthand experience in managing and executing U.S. foreign and defense policy abroad.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, AHS stands for basic principles in U.S. foreign policy that include:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A conviction, rooted in the history of the last century, that the world is a better, safer, and more prosperous place when the United States is willing and able to lead. And a commitment to maintaining the moral authority and material strength on which that leadership rests.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An appreciation that the world remains a dangerous place in which our power must be exercised with prudence, and where the primary threats to our security come from states that deny freedom to their own people and from non-state actors who embrace hatred and violence.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clear recognition that, in such a world, our true friends and reliable partners are other democratic nations with whom we share an enduring commonality of values, and not simply a temporary convergence of interests.</span></li>\r\n</ul>",

With an active focus in social, philanthropic, and sisterhood activities, the young women of Alpha Chi strive to make an impact in our community and the Michigan campus as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>Each one of our young women is unique. With members from the east to the west coast, and even overseas, our various backgrounds help to enrich the experiences of every Alpha Chi. From an academic standpoint, diversity continues to shape our house with members pursuing degrees in Literature, Science, and the Arts, Engineering, Art and Design, Nursing, Business, and much more. Members of the Theta Chapter not only uphold their academic integrity, but they also strive to uphold the other principles of an Alpha Chi as well such as personal development and their leadership abilities. Our young women are active in over 80 organizations on campus ranging from A Cappella groups to club sports and many hold prominent leadership positions throughout campus.</p>\r\n<p>Although each member is different and we are a diverse chapter, the presence of Alpha Chi Omega and the sisterhood that it offers shape our college experiences in a similar way. Activities such as painting &ldquo;the rock,&rdquo; all chapter lunches,&nbsp;as well as picnics in the Arb, and philanthropy events help bring together the different pledge classes of the Theta Chapter.</p>\r\n<p>Giving back to the Ann Arbor community is one of the most rewarding aspects of being an Alpha Chi at Michigan. Because the Women&rsquo;s Center of Southeastern Michigan is located right here in Ann Arbor, we are lucky enough to have members volunteer their time weekly to help women and children in need. It is in this way that our members are fortunate enough to personally see their hard philanthropic work be put to use. We take pride in philanthropic endeavors throughout the year and encourage our members to pursue community service regularly. We regularly participate in other sororities&rsquo; and fraternities&rsquo; philanthropies as well as in the University-wide Greek Week to support various philanthropic organizations in the area.</p>\r\n<p>The Theta Chapter of Alpha Chi Omega truly is &ldquo;The Michigan Difference.&rdquo; &nbsp;To all of the alumnae, please feel free to contact me at axoumichpresident@gmail.com for any information about our chapter! We would love to hear your success stories and about how the bonds that we will create today extend beyond these four years at Michigan.</p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\r\n<p>Chapter President</p>",

It has retained its focus on its literary roots, by attracting only the best students at only the best colleges and universities in Canada and the United States. A majority of its chapters are leaders on their respective campuses, where some of their houses have been designated architectural or historic landmarks. The Alpha Delta Phi experience has helped a disproportionate number of its 50,000 lifelong members to become top leaders in industry, government, education, and religion.<br /><br />The Peninsular Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi welcomes alumni brothers, undergraduate brothers and others who are interested in learning more about this distinguished brotherhood.

On Friday, April 10, 2009, the Epsilon Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. reached its 100th year in existence.

A testament to this truth, Epsilon Chapter boasts 10&#43; Phi Beta Kappa Members, 10&#43; Athletic All-Americans as recently as 2000, and a steady stream of honors, awards, and accolades\r\n for service. We strive through comradeship to attain the noble goal of a balance between social and academic life and have proven wrong those who declare that both of these phase of existence are incompatible and mutually inhibitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe understand and recognize that past is prologue to the future and that an intimate familiarity with and reverence for what has gone on before is both central and essential to our ongoing development and survival. Brotherhood, scholarship, leadership, and\r\n service, the four principles upon which the Jewels founded Alpha Phi Alpha, continue to be the guiding values of Epsilon. It can be said that fraternity life in Alpha Phi Alpha has shown us that the ideals to which we aspire are worth striving for and that\r\n Epsilon chapter continues to be a \u2018rendezvous for fraters, a sanctuary for scholars, and a haven for gentlemen.\u2019</p>\r\n",

We acheive this goal by providing a wide variety of projects. Some of our most popular projects are the UM vs. OSU Blood Battle, Knitwits, Crafts for Motts, and Passing Notes.</p>\r\n<p>The rush process for Alpha Phi Omega is held at the beginning of the fall and winter semesters, and at these times the chapter will hold mass meetings to help inform students about the organization. While this phase of joining the organization is called \"rush\", it is not very similar to the rush you would participate in for Greek houses -- it is extremely easy and non-competitive.</p>\r\n<p>During the week of our mass meeting, we hold a series of rush events, which are open to anyone interested in joining APO (these often include&nbsp;service projects, happy hours, and&nbsp;fellowship&nbsp;events). These give you a chance to get to know members of APO and see if it's something you'd like to be a part of. There is no \"bid\" selection - anyone who wants to be a member of APO can join.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anyone interested in APO may attend a Pledge Initiation Ceremony to become an APO Pledge Member. The Pledge Initiation Ceremony will be at the beginning of each semester, after rush has ended.</p>\r\n<p>Your first semester in APO will be full of opportunities to learn about the organization and find your place in it. That is the essence of the pledge process. You will undergo an initiation ritual, and be assigned to a \"big\" - an older APO member who will answer any questions you have and help you figure out the ins and outs of APO. You will attend all the same meetings as the Active Brothers do, and you will also attend pledge meetings, which help you get to know other people as well as the history and purpose of APO.</p>\r\n<p>Weekly meetings allow pledges to learn about the history of APO, our mission, and our members. During the course of the term, pledges are required to complete service hours as well as other requirements, detailed in full on our&nbsp;pledge requirements&nbsp;page.</p>\r\n<p>Check us out on Instagram <a href=\"http://instagram.com/apouofm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> @apouofm</a></p>\r\n<p>Check out our website apouofm.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The single most important aspect of becoming a member of APX is the opportunity to establish both professional and social relationships that will continue long after college. These lines of communication provide opportunities for students and professionals alike to grow in ways unique to Alpha Rho Chi. Activities outside of the classroom or studio encourage the mutual respect and support necessary for a lifetime of opportunity and friendship. The strong ties of brotherhood set Alpha Rho Chi apart from other professional organizations, yet a shared professional interest in architecture and the allied arts differentiates Alpha Rho Chi from other greek letter societies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",
        "Summary": "Alpha Rho Chi is a national professional co-ed fraternity for students of architecture and the allied arts. It was founded in 1914 to organize and unite in fellowship the architectural students in the universities and colleges of America.",

In this annual competition, a corporate sponsor (client) provides a case study outlining the history of its product and current challenge. Past clients include Tide, Coca-Cola, Meta Quest 2, Tinder and Tide. Students must research the product and its competition, identify pain points for its consumers, and devise a comprehensive campaign for the client. Each student team then \"pitches\" its campaign to a panel of judges, and the winning Presentation+Plansbook may become part of the company's next ad campaign.</p>\r\n<p>For more information, please contact Eduarda Galera at eduardar@umich.edu.&nbsp;</p>",

The University of Michigan chapter continues this effort at a local level. There are many opportunities to get involved in ALCSI, from canvassing communities, to contacting local officials, creating content, and more. We our advised directly by\r\n University of Michigan physician and are also connected to a network of physicians across the country through their involvement with ALCSI. This club is a great way to make a large impact with relatively low commitment as well as an opportunity for pre-med\r\n students to grow their network with physicians across the country.</p>\r\n",

        "Description": "<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />ASME International was founded in 1880 as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.&nbsp; Today's ASME is a 120,000-member professional organization focused on technical, educational and research issues of the engineering and technology community.&nbsp;<br /><br />ASME at the University of Michigan is one of the largest and most active Engineering Societies out of more than 70 registered groups. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers at the University of Michigan strives to enhance the professional and social lives of its members as well as other students in the college through a variety of academic, professional, social, community service, and student-faculty events.</p>\r\n<p><strong>General Body Meetings</strong><br />ASME holds bi-weekly general body meetings for its members, during which members hear from a variety of speakers. For some meetings, we invite mechanical engineering professors to speak about their research to show students the broad range of applications of a degree in Mechanical Engineering as well as emerging technologies. We also have professional development seminars to aid our members in their career development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Corporate Luncheons</strong><br />One of ASME&rsquo;s more popular events is its company luncheons. Our group invites both technical and recruiting staff to speak to students. Company representatives speak about the current state of their industry, the functions of engineers in their company, and opportunities for students (be it summer jobs, or permanent hires). These events are open to all engineering students, not just ASME members or mechanical engineering students. These events are designed to allow students the opportunity to learn about potential employers and allow company representatives a chance to reach talented students at the University of Michigan. Lunch is provided to students and speakers. See our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/societies/asme/Corporate.html\">corporate information page</a>&nbsp;for more details and our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/societies/asme/Calendar.html\">calendar</a>&nbsp;for upcoming luncheons.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Social Events</strong><br />In addition to meetings held on campus, ASME strives to&nbsp;provide a social atmosphere to its members outside the academic setting. Our group does this by sponsoring intramural sports teams in which members join together and compete against other societies at the university. In addition to sporting events, ASME hosts a variety of social activities. Some examples include bowling night, ice skating night, and card tournaments. The strong bonds and team-member atmosphere developed in these events extend into the classroom setting. Upper-class members are brought together with lower-class members to help students create a network of contact and friendship within such a large Mechanical Engineering department.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Service Events</strong><br />ASME strives to be a community service group as well. One of our biggest events is the Fun Run, a 5K run for charity. We co-sponsor this event with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/soc/swe/\">Society of Women Engineers (SWE)</a>. The purpose of this event is to raise money for the local charities in Ann Arbor. Corporate sponsors are sought to help make this event possible. In addition to Fun Run, ASME participates in other community service events. We make and host a dinner at the children&rsquo;s hospital twice a year, we participate in a clean-up of local parks twice a year, and we volunteer at soup kitchens in Ann Arbor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Student-Faculty Relations</strong><br />To encourage communication between students and faculty, ASME co-hosts a student-faculty-mixer once a semester. During this event, ASME provides a full buffet of breakfast to students and faculty in the Mechanical Engineering department. ASME officers and engineering professors make pancakes for students and other faculty.</p>",

The&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;chapter was formed in 1969 to deal mainly with the recruitment and support of Black graduate students and faculty.<br /><br />At its height, membership rose to more than 60 students, and the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;became a leader in the training of Black Ph.D.'s in Psychology.<br /><br />During the early 1970's, the Department received more than 100 Black applications annually. The Department of Psychology has always entrusted BSPA with the responsibility of reviewing all applications from Black students prior to going to the area admission committees. Through this endeavor, commitment to the support of its members, both socially and academically, as well as an effort to actively recruit and prepare Black undergraduates for graduate study, BSPA became one of the most respected organizations on campus.<br /><br />The BSPA maintains the respect of the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;by continuing to be an active force in recruitment of graduate students of color in psychology. In addition, the organization continues to provide social and academic support for its members, and also strives to be an active force in the community. Most recently, the organization has begun efforts to strengthen its ties with BSPA alumni. In so doing, the organization aims to both create a viable resource for support and professional socialization and acknowledge the accomplishments of a rich legacy. A large portion of BSPA's strength lies in its history. May the legacy continue.</p>",

We have organized multiple panel discussions for members of the College of Engineering featuring\r\n the voices and experiences of Black students, professors, and alumni. BSA strives to initiate and facilitate positive dialogue between Black students and the UM Aerospace Department, and we now work in conjunction with the College of Engineering\u2019s Office of\r\n Culture, Community and Equity (OCCE) to address issues that Black Aerospace students face at UM.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">We also promote our members' professional development skills through hosting events with companies that span from resume workshops to crash courses about various aerospace careers. We sponsor members to attend a number of conferences\r\n throughout the year including SciTech, an annual conference put on by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) for engineers to learn about advances in aerospace research, development, and technology. Recently, we sent 14 of our members\r\n to the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) annual convention in March 2024, to help them secure jobs and build relationships with industry experts.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">BSA also strives to develop the technical skills of our members to aid them as they go into industry. In Fall 2024, we launched our CubeSat Demonstration Program, which was designed to enrich the technical skills of underclassmen\r\n who have not previously held an internship. Aiming to be a 40-hour semester long asynchronous course, the enrolled students, assisted by BSA upperclassmen that volunteer to be CDP facilitators, create a CubeSat that measures pressure, gyroscope data, acceleration,\r\n and altitude. As of Spring 2025, we have successfully put 12 students through the program.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">BSA works tirelessly to ensure that Black students feel empowered and confident in their pursuit of an education in the aerospace industry.

        "Description": "<div>Sa&rsquo; Nima&rsquo; Collaborative has partnered with CasaSito, an educational NGO in San Crist&oacute;bal, Guatemala, for the past 10 years. Our team&rsquo;s mission is to use engineering solutions to improve the lives of CasaSito scholars and their families. Over the past few years, our team has prototyped hand-powered washing machines and ventilated wood-burning stoves to save the families time washing clothes and to alleviate health problems caused by inhaling smoke. Members of our team traveled to San Crist&oacute;bal in May 2023 and again in May 2024 to implement these washing machines and stoves in the homes of families in the community. Our team also hosted two hands-on engineering workshops with scholars in San Crist&oacute;bal and Antigua to expose them to the engineering design process as well as to possible careers in engineering. In May 2025, our team traveled to San Crist&oacute;bal to build more stoves and conduct a needs assessment for a new rainwater collection project. In the 2025-26 year, our team will continue working on this rainwater collection project to ensure that families have reliable access to water.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>",

Here on the campus of the University of Michigan we meet every Thursday for our weekly Bible study, usually at the Michigan League, in which we focus on a part of the Bible that we can apply to our lives as students. We also run Zoom for those who cannot make it to the meeting in person. Please contact Nathan (<a href=\"mailto:lydick@umich.edu\">lydick@umich.edu</a>) for the Zoom link. These meetings are also a great way to meet your fellow U of M students and just vent about the week of classes. During non-pandemic times, we also have monthly parties on Friday which are hosted by a local family. There really is no agenda for these parties other than to show up with a healthy appetite, a desire to enjoy a home-cooked meal, and be ready to meet a lot of people, play some games and have a good time. We also take Mission trips throughout the year, which can vary from year to year on where we go and what we do. If you are curious, please join our meetings on Thursday and check out our website (<a href=\"http://www.christianchallenge.us\">www.christianchallenge.us</a>). We always welcome new people and we look forward to meeting you. Go Blue!</p>",

Second, we plan and run symposia to summarize the events of the conference for our community, bring together experts in the field to answer questions, and highlight opportunities for interested citizens to get involved. We are currently conducting research on opportunities for conferences like COP to reach carbon neutrality.

As opposed to cheap fabrics made of plastics that take thousands of years to decompose and rely on abysmal labor standards to produce, we source sustainable materials and since we start from scratch, we get to design all our garments and accessories <br /><br />At VIPs Club, we sell these clothes, stuffed toys, bags, hats, etc. through VIPs Fund, a nonprofit created by university students for this exact purpose. 100% of funds raised through making these sales go directly towards wildlife conservation projects that we develop ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>Membership is open to anyone who is interested in wildlife conservation, fiber art, fashion design, sewing, jewelry, nonprofit work, website building, marketing, advocacy, or any other skill you think would further the mission of Crochet for Conservation and VIPs Fund.

The department offers a variety of course options, from dynamic larger classes that cover a wide exposure to the discipline to interactive smaller classes where students delve deeply into specific topics of interest. Students in our program pursue learning opportunities outside of the classroom, such as volunteer work at community sites (SOC 225), faculty and doctoral student research assistance (SOC 394), study abroad, undergraduate speakers series events, and independent research and writing through our Honors Program in Sociology. We invite you to browse through our website (https://lsa.umich.edu/soc/undergraduates.html) and reach out to us at socadvisor@umich.edu if you have questions about our majors, minors, courses, or department opportunities.

It released on Steam just over seven years ago on June 4th, 2015, soon after which my father discovered it and introduced\r\n it to my siblings and I. <em>Duck Game</em> was a beloved family pastime for us, and some years later when I received a laptop of my very own, I purchased a digital copy of\r\n<em>Duck Game</em> in my own name to carry on the legacy.

        "Description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The initiative to establish FLUX (Figma Learning for UX) at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor stems from a recognition of the evolving landscape in design education and the growing importance of proficiency in design tools such as Figma. Our primary objective is to address the existing gap in practical Figma skills among students by providing a platform for hands-on learning and engagement.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FLUX aims to serve as a catalyst for enhancing students' preparedness for careers in UX and related fields by offering workshops, guest lectures, and interactive sessions focused on Figma and its applications in design. Given the diverse academic backgrounds of our student body, many may not have had exposure to the latest design tools crucial for success in contemporary industries. By bridging this gap, FLUX endeavors to empower students across disciplines to develop essential skills in design and technology, thereby augmenting their professional readiness and competitiveness.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In alignment with the University of Michigan's commitment to holistic education and innovation, FLUX seeks to become a cornerstone student organization for Figma proficiency, catering to the needs of current and future students alike. Through collaborative learning experiences and community building, FLUX endeavors to foster a culture of creativity, innovation, and excellence within the university ecosystem.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, FLUX aims for students to have fun, share with their peers and learn hard skills for their career advancement.</span></p>",

They called their collaboration \u201cFilmic.\u201d</p>\r\n<p>Soon after its founding, Filmic was presented with the opportunity to start telling stories about Michigan, working with administrators across the University \u2013 in Student Life, Development, Athletics, and Admissions to name just a few \u2013 to chronicle the\r\n student experience through film. And thus, Filmic became U-M\u2019s first student-led creative production company.\r\n<span style=\"font-weight:400\">We specialize in creative storytelling and are dedicated to developing unique ideas that stand out among typical commercial videos; from pre- to post-production we take a vision from concept to reality, while engaging diverse perspectives\r\n and embracing our motto of </span><em><span style=\"font-weight:400\">cinema everywhere.\r\n</span></em><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Filmic Productions has had the opportunity to work with notable clients including Lady Gaga\u2019s\r\n</span><a href=\"https://filmicprods.com/work/channel-kindness\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Born This Way Foundation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">,\r\n</span><a href=\"https://filmicprods.com/work/dance-building\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Michigan Dance Building</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, and\r\n</span><a href=\"https://filmicprods.com/work/otzi-skincare\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">OTZI Skin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">, a California-based cosmetics company.</span></p>\r\n<p>Filmic\u2019s core credo \u2013 \u201cCinema Everywhere\u201d \u2013 stems from a collective belief that any story can be made cinematic and impactful, and its members bring that energy to every project they take on.</p>\r\n<p>If you're interested in joining Filmic, our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRETiNcUWv1YyP47LMmvd5oJz-vlCyvA48EhubCTrnj6G8mQ/viewform\">\r\napplication</a> is due on September 12th 2023 by 11:59pm!

Proving that \"guys have rhythm\" was not the hardest part however. It was the late nights (practicing at Angell Hall, the Diag, the CCRB, or&nbsp;anywhere with some space and an electrical outlet) and the early mornings squeezed in-between the crush of academic and social commitments that truly showed us the importance of dance and brotherhood. All the hard work paid off each and every year, as FunKtion quickly grew into a recognizable entity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FunKtion has been invited to perform at various events such as Festifall, A Taste of Culture, Encompass, Dance Marathon, Michigan Homecoming, Greek Week, KSA, Sixth Day, Celebrasia, Noir Fashion Show, Pioneer High School, 58 Greene concerts, Dance Mix, and a Detroit Pistons game.&nbsp;In its short history, FunKtion has traveled from the Midwest (UIUC, GVSU, Northwestern, opening for Jocelyn Enriquez) to the East Coast (Columbia for ECASU), opening for JCole. and it only gets bigger as FunKtion continually works to expand its repertoire and its presence.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The FunKtion family is reaching towards you with open arms and shuffling feet. Come support us wherever the bass reverberates and the boys dance.</p>\r\n<p><br />We dance. You scream. FunKtion on three...</p>",

        "Description": "\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">It all began in early 1997 when a group of University of Michigan Arts Chorale members got together to sing some a cappella music. After much debate and many poetry recitations, the group adopted the name &quot;Gimble\r\n in the Wabe&quot; from Lewis Carroll's poem,&nbsp;Jabberwocky. Since first performing in April of 1998, the group\u2019s name has been refined to Gimble A Cappella, and has evolved into the self-proclaimed quirkiest a cappella group on campus! Each year, Gimblers unite to\r\n host 3 concerts and can frequently be seen performing at various events on campus and around the country during their annual spring tour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Gimble released 7 studio albums on CD before their recent releases on streaming platforms. In 2017, they released a 4-song EP, \u201cXX,\u201d in celebration of their 20th anniversary. Featuring hits like \u201cIf I Go\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m\r\n with You\u201d, it motivated a wave of new releases. Singles \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d and \u201c715 - CR\u2211\u2211KS\u201d debuted in 2018, followed by \u201cFallingwater\u201d and \u201cwhen the party\u2019s over\u201d late in 2019. In 2020, they released their 5-song EP \u201chome,\u201d aptly named both for the home\r\n they shared together and the unmistakable familial atmosphere of the group. Shortly thereafter, Gimble returned with powerhouse covers of Brandi Carlile's &quot;The Joke&quot; and Hozier's &quot;Movement&quot;. Gimble is excited to continue recording their original arrangements\r\n for many years to come!</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Going strong in its 27th year, Gimble A Cappella continues the tradition with a few fresh faces and a continued passion for a cappella music.

        "Description": "<p><strong>Our Model&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global health equity starts within our local communities, which is why the Global Health Alliance at the University of Michigan (GHA) is proud to partner locally as well as globally. We and our partner organizations, Green Umbrella School in Cambodia and Avalon Housing and Washtenaw Literacy in Michigan, aim to maintain long-term partnerships in the name of sustainability to maximize impact. The rights to education, housing, and basic literacy are some of the most important health determinants, and their impacts can have generational effects. GHA aims to support our partner organizations through mutual learning, respect, and understanding. By engaging with self-sufficient local organizations, we gain valuable insights that help us support international partners, like Green Umbrella School, in their journey toward self-sufficiency.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our chapter of the Global Health Alliance is an independent student-run organization and one of the nation's first to partner with three local and international non-profit organizations. Our first partner is Avalon Housing in Ann Arbor, MI. We work with them by helping run the front desk, beautification projects, and art events. Our second partner is Washtenaw Literacy, also in Ann Arbor, MI. With them, we teach English as a Second Language (ESL) to local community members.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our partner outside of the United States is Green Umbrella School in the Putsor Community near Phnom Penh, Cambodia, which believes in the potential of today's youth. Green Umbrella provides quality education to disenfranchised families to achieve sustainable development, facilitates leadership programs to enhance confidence and unity within the community, and leads livelihood workshops for adults and English classes for children. We raise an annual $5,000 for our international partner and assist with their assessment research and education modeling during our 3-week trip every summer. At our Monday night meetings, we plan fundraising and volunteer events and hold discussion-based lessons about public health issues.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why we are a global health club:</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GHA is a global health club because we understand that health does not follow political borders. Global health work is more than collaborating with partners in lower-income countries; it recognizes the local and international connection. Our work abroad informs us of how we solve complex challenges at home and vice versa. We aim to address some of the most significant social determinants of health: education, housing, and literacy rates. Our work involves fundraising efforts combined with co-designing programming with our partners and reflects our commitment to addressing the issues affecting billions of people worldwide. Through our annual efforts with our partners and our weekly club discussions on campus, we aim to understand the complexities of public health issues and take meaningful action to create lasting change&mdash;locally and globally.</span></p>",

        "Description": "\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Global Surgery Student Alliance (GSSA) aims to educate undergraduate students about global healthcare inequities. GSSA has multiple chapters at different undergraduate universities and medical schools. The undergraduate\r\n U of M chapter will host events, workshops, seminars, and webinars with healthcare professionals. The chapter will also organize and facilitate resume workshops and study groups. The events that GSSA hosts will primarily be educational in nature, while also\r\n integrating service and research opportunities for impact in the community. For example, there are many activities we may host including but not limited to suturing events, hackathons, emergency medicine clinics, and panels. Members of GSSA also have the opportunity\r\n to foster connections with U of M medical school students and practicing medical professionals in the global health field.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Health care is a human right, and GSSA hopes to act as a resource for students to learn about providing care to patients. Though GSSA is a pre-health organization, it also highlights the multidisciplinary nature of healthcare.\r\n Healthcare is a complex topic that does not simply start with going into the doctor\u2019s office. It also involves other disciplines, such as pharmacy, business, public policy, and engineering. We believe that students of differing academic and intellectual backgrounds\r\n are vital to the success of our organization.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">We hope to inspire future healthcare providers, encouraging them to think about healthcare and surgery from a broader, more global perspective.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n",
        "Summary": "The mission of the U of M chapter of Global Surgery Student Alliance is to promote conversations about global surgery and related health inequities that will help engage, excite, and inspire our members and our U of M community.\r\n",

We desire to spur one another on in our mutual journey of faith, to grapple seriously with the intellectual issues of our times from a Christian perspective, and to engage the campus with Jesus Christ. To that end, we have the following objectives:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Spiritual Formation</h3>\r\nGCF is committed to the ongoing development of faithful disciples of Jesus Christ. Through the disciplines of Bible study, prayer, and worship, we seek to become more Christ-like in all areas of our lives. Through small group Bible studies, prayer groups, large group speakers, retreats, and training opportunities, we strive to meet graduate students wherever they are in their spiritual journeys and to challenge them to continued growth and development.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Integration of Faith and Academics</h3>\r\nWe believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord of our whole lives, including both the personal and public areas. As Christian graduate and professional students, Christ calls us to excellence in scholarship and career as well as unwavering obedience to His Word. GCF is committed to affirm the Christian worldview in the university culture by presenting Christian thought in ways that are meaningful to our colleagues and by supporting each other as we explore our call to be servants of Christ in our culture.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Evangelism and Service</h3>\r\nOur primary mission field is the university. We believe that God cares about the university, both the institution and the people who study and work there. Because we feel that the best way to reach other graduate students is through one-on-one relationships, we put emphasis on training and encouraging individuals to reach out to non-Christian friends and colleagues. In addition, we organize regular service opportunities for graduate students to help those in need in our community.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Fellowship</h3>\r\nAs graduate and professional students, we are called to live out Christ's love as a community of believers. We desire to be known as a group that has genuine love for one another. Through our Bible studies and prayer groups, large groups, social events and retreats, we can develop friendships which serve as a base of support and encouragement during challenging times.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_aboutSection\">\r\n<h2>The Fellowship</h2>\r\n<p>Graduate Christian Fellowship is a Chapter of <a title=\"InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA\" href=\"http://www.intervaristy.org/\"> InterVarsity Christian Fellowship</a>, which in turn is part of a world-wide, student-led Christian movement, active in colleges and universities, known as the <a title=\"IFES Website\" href=\"http://www.ifesworld.org/default.asp\">International Fellowship of Evangelical Students</a> (IFES). GCF seeks to minister to graduate students through a variety of student-led programs and activities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Small Group Bible Studies</h3>\r\n<a title=\"GCF Small Group Bible Studies\" href=\"http://www.umich.edu/%7Egcf/biblestudy.html\">Small groups</a> are the heart of GCF. Meeting weekly for Bible study, prayer, worship, and outreach, these groups (usually 6-10 people) are a key source of support, fellowship, and study.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Large Group Meetings</h3>\r\nThe chapter regularly gathers as a large group for corporate worship and either a speaker or a facilitated discussion.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Prayer Meetings</h3>\r\nGCF coordinates weekly <a title=\"GCF Prayer Meetings\" href=\"http://www.umich.edu/%7Egcf/prayer.html\"> prayer meetings</a>.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Outreach</h3>\r\nGCF sponsors various programs to reach out to the University community. We seek to engage the campus with our faith on an intellectual level, as well as train and encourage others to do the same.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Other Activities</h3>\r\nGCF also organizes a variety of special activities, including reading or discussion groups, departmental prayer groups, and various social events, retreats, and conferences.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_aboutSection\">\r\n<h2>Basis of Faith</h2>\r\n<p>As a chapter of <a title=\"InterVarsity Christian Fellowhip/USA\" href=\"http://www.intervarsity.org/\"> InterVarsity Christian Fellowship</a>, Graduate Christian Fellowship is committed to the doctrinal basis of InterVarsity:</p>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_doctrine\">\r\n<p>The only true God, the almighty Creator of all things, existing eternally in three persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - full of love and glory.</p>\r\n<p>The unique divine inspiration, entire trustworthiness and authority of the Bible.</p>\r\n<p>The value and dignity of all people: created in God's image to live in love and holiness, but alienated from God and each other because of our sin and guilt, and justly subject to God's wrath.</p>\r\n<p>Jesus Christ, fully human and fully divine, who lived as a perfect example, who assumed the judgment due sinners by dying in our place, and who was bodily raised from the dead and ascended as Savior and Lord.</p>\r\n<p>Justification by God's grace to all who repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation.</p>\r\n<p>The indwelling presence and transforming power of the Holy Spirit, who gives to all believers a new life and a new calling to obedient service.</p>\r\n<p>The unity of all believers in Jesus Christ, manifest in worshiping and witnessing churches making disciples throughout the world.</p>\r\n<p>The victorious reign and future personal return of Jesus Christ, who will judge all people with justice and mercy, giving over the unrepentant to eternal condemnation but receiving the redeemed into eternal life.</p>\r\n<p>To God be glory forever.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

We offer special seminars, courses, and direct involvement with faculty from the start of students' lives at Michigan. Students are expected to elect half their course work in Honors; many do more. Many Honors students participate in research during their first two years, and almost all Honors seniors pursue their own independent research projects under the guidance of a faculty mentor, leading to an Honors senior thesis.</p>\r\n<p>To help students take the greatest advantage of the rich opportunities at Michigan, Honors advisors meet with them individually, beginning at Orientation and continuing throughout their time here.</p>\r\n<h3>Honors Community</h3>\r\n<p>A vibrant community, no single experience unites all Honors students, yet all are connected through a wide range of activities that enable students to choose what interests them. The Perlman Honors Commons is an intellectual hub, located on the ground floor of Mason Hall (above the Honors offices) where students and faculty come together for study, conversation, and a variety of intellectual and cultural events in truly beautiful surroundings.&nbsp;Organized by the Honor's Resident Advisors (HRAs), you will find students attending musicals, sports events, and visiting coffee hours. Faculty Fellows engage Honors students in a wide variety of ways outside of formal classes. There's something for everyone and all are invited.</p>",

        "Description": "<p><strong>Judo (\u67d4\u9053)</strong> is a modern grappling martial art and combat sport that originated in Japan. Judo means \"the gentle way\" in Japanese, reflecting its emphasis on using an opponent's force and movements to one's advantage rather than opposing them with brute strength. Its techniques primarily involve throws, pins, joint locks, and strangles. Judo is not only a martial art but also an <strong>Olympic sport</strong> since 1964. Judo is one of the most popular sports in the world with 128 participating nations in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games compared to Wrestling at 61&nbsp; participating nations.<br /><br />At <strong>Judo at Michigan (JAM)</strong>, students have the opportunity to learn and practice the sport of Judo. They will acquire essential self-defense skills, improve their physical fitness, and develop mental discipline. As an official sport club, we compete at tournaments (not mandatory, although highly encouraged) across Michigan and offer leadership opportunities. Our club provides a welcoming and inclusive environment for students of all skill levels, from beginners to experienced practitioners.<br /><br /><strong>Safety</strong> is a priority, hence, members with no experience, they will first be taught how to fall before getting any combat involvement. Ukemi (\u53d7\u8eab), known as the art of falling safely and efficiently, will teach you several core principles, including relaxation, proper body positioning (such as not posting on your hands or elbows), and controlled breathing, to dissipate the energy of a throw or fall, reducing the risk of injury.<br /><br />Then, students will practice <strong>throwing</strong> and <strong>grappling </strong> techniques.<br /><br /><strong>Schedule:</strong> Judo training sessions occur on Saturday (3:00-5:00 PM), and Sunday (3:00-5:00 PM) in the Michigan League 3rd Floor.

Practices will start off with warm-ups and Ukemi practice. Next, throws will be practiced. Afterward, we will do randori (sparring) or learn new ground techniques.

We promote health and nutrition education through enriching after-school activities for children from under-resourced school districts and low-income neighborhoods in Washtenaw County. We are an organization comprised of University of Michigan students who lead baking activities with the youth at Community Action Network, Mentor2Youth, and Foundations Preschool. During these workshops, we teach developmentally appropriate cooking skills and nutrition to children ranging from ages 3-14. We develop lesson plans using recipes with ingredients that are familiar, nutritious, and inexpensive. Our lesson plans generate excitement for healthy food, as well as curiosity about what makes food good for us and why we need to eat healthfully. We plan hands-on activities that allow the children to do the preparation and cooking themselves. This independence and agency empowers the kids to become engaged in and take ownership of what they are putting into their bodies. Kids' Kitchen recognizes the importance of instilling healthy habits at young ages that will last for a lifetime, and we aim to capitalize on this to improve long-term health&nbsp;behaviors and outcomes.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>On December 1, 1975, history was made &ndash; history on a college campus, which would transcend other colleges/universities throughout the United States; history which would have a positive impact on the Latino community and our nation; history which would forever change the Greek system, more specifically, the entity known as a fraternity. On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.<br /><br />In 1975, there were no Latino fraternities in existence in the United States. The Greek-letter organizations of the time primarily catered to Anglo and African-American students and graduates. Lambda&rsquo;s founders, as men of vision, realized there was a need to unite the Latino students, develop their leadership skills, impart upon them the value of an education, and instill in them a commitment to their community and culture. The traditional student club would not suffice to accomplish such lofty goals. Hence, Latino unity and brotherhood would be achieved through a long recognized institution &ndash; the fraternity. This newest addition to the Greek system would be the first in the nation, by identity and by name: Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Incorporated.<br /><br />The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the undergraduate level, our brothers are active within the Fraternity and in other student organizations. Our brothers perform community service, promote our culture by sponsoring events which highlight and celebrate our heritage, participate in educational workshops, and enjoy many social programs. As a result of their active participation in every aspect of college life, our undergraduates are developing their organizational, communication, and leadership skills, all while pursuing the coveted diploma. Our younger Lambdas are receiving the training and competence to serve as the future leaders of our brotherhood, community, and nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the professional level, among our ranks you will find attorneys, doctors, and engineers. Our brothers are shaping young minds as educators and as dedicated fathers. The men in brown and white are defending this country at home and abroad in the area of law enforcement and in the armed forces. We are strengthening our country&rsquo;s economy as entrepreneurs. Our brothers are teaching leadership as coaches, mentors, and community activists. The Lambdas are affecting policy and change as elected officials serving on City Councils, Boards of Education, U.S. House of Representatives, and U.S. Senate. In short, Lambdas are contributing and excelling in every facet of human endeavor.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our illustrious history is not only our past but our guiding light to the future. As the first, we overcame many obstacles. Not having much guidance in our formative stages, we persevered and became stronger. Lambda is the product of vision, strength, and unity. Our history serves as a legacy and testament to our accomplishments and greatness.<br /><br />Lambda Theta Phi &hellip; Academic Excellence &ndash; Brotherhood &ndash; Leadership &ndash; Latino Unity -Service.</p>",

Throughout the year, LSPA holds several events for its members and for the larger campus and Latinx community, including lectures.</span><br /><br />Although a Latinx-oriented psychology organization existed briefly in the 1980's it became defunct a few years later. In 1996, a group of students who believed in the importance of creating a supportive community for Latinx students formed The Latinx Student Psychological Association, which has been active since then.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_Free_Form\"><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_style_3\">Membership is open to graduate students, faculty, and staff at the University of Michigan who self-identify as Latinx and/or are committed to supporting the Latino community. LSPA invites participation from all members of the University of Michigan community and abides by the University of Michigan's non-discrimination policy.</span></p>",

America's higher education system is often a major step in creating a professional career, but differences in income between applicants to colleges and universities can give major advantages to some, including personal college advisors, standardized test tutors, and application essay help.</p>\r\n<p>LEAP's mission is to offer many of these advantages to students who may otherwise not be able to afford them by providing free college counseling and standardized test tutoring services. Volunteers with LEAP will meet virtually or in person with students in the program and help them with whatever college-admissions related questions or services they may need. We are in connection with local (Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti area) schools and community centers who pass along this information to students who may need it.</p>\r\n<p>Getting involved in LEAP is a great way to earn volunteer hours in a meaningful way! The relationships created with students and the opportunities tutors offer to these students are truly incredible. Tutoring guidelines, resources, and contacts will be provided by LEAP, and at least one hour of tutoring each week (virtual or in person) is required as a member. Schedules for tutoring are arranged with the tutor and their student.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>LEAP is continuously accepting applications. Please submit an application if you are interested in getting involved, or use the email listed below to request more information!</p>",

Living Grace Ministry is one ministry of the Korean United Methodist Church of Ann Arbor. On Sundays, we worship together with other age-groups at our physical church building which is a short five-minute drive from campus. Our campus ministry has a number of events and activities that take place on and around campus, including a vibrant network of small groups. We are Christ-centered, outreach and mission-minded, and dedicated to training and equipping disciples and leaders. All are welcome to join our growing community of Christ. You are not alone!</p>",

We put on an annual show which has been showcased at the Michigan Theater and the Mendelssohn Theater, along with various\r\n events on campus, including Springfest and the Parent's Weekend Tailgate. But our performances aren't just limited to on campus events- L\u00e9im Irish dancers enjoy performing&nbsp;at events like&nbsp;Midnight Madness in downtown Ann Arbor, and collaborating with local\r\n schools and assisted living facilities. We also compete in intercollegiate Irish dance competitions against other university teams from across the country.

        "Description": "\r\n<p>FEED (Facilitating Effective Eating Devices)&nbsp;is a biomedical engineering project team under the umbrella organization M-HEAL, started up during the Fall 2017 semester. The team\u2019s primary focus is on developing a wearable device for older adults to help minimize\r\n damage / injury during a fall incident. In the United States, fall trauma in hospitalized environments is a large issue that current infrastructure only passively addresses. Relevant current solutions include remote presence devices, bedside alert systems,\r\n and strength reliant assistive devices such as walkers and canes. While these product do a good job of mobilizing hospital infrastructure in response to a fall incident, they depend on caregivers and do not mitigate the damage already done.</p>\r\n<p>Although we are focused primarily on hospitalized, high-risk patients, although options with more autonomous elderly individuals / rehabilitation devices are also being explored. Alongside advising physicians in both U of M Geriatrics and U of M Physical\r\n Medicine and Rehabilitation, our team emphasizes working closely with patients and caregivers to solidify the needs of these key users to help drive and engage our own design process. We hope to provide students opportunities to participate in all parts of\r\n the design process from needs assessment to prototyping, as well as chances to work side by side with healthcare partners and patients. Our goal is to ultimately design a device that not only makes life safer for older adult patients, but also to make caregivers\u2019\r\n jobs easier.</p>\r\n",

They chose to focus on hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), more commonly referred to as neonatal asphyxia; a condition that is one of the leading causes of death for newborns. Research identified hypothermia therapy as the only medical intervention shown to improve infant brain function, and so they set a goal: to design a device that would safely and effectively apply the therapy to mitigate the complications associated with the condition. Since then, NAP has grown into a multidisciplinary team of students who continue to work to achieve this goal. We are currently designing and building different device prototypes.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>Under anesthesia required for surgical procedures, a patient experiences vasodilation and loses the ability to properly regulate their body temperature, causing a core-to-peripheral redistribution of body heat. If core body temperature drops below 36.0 \u2103, it becomes perioperative hypothermia, which may lead to cardiac events, impaired pharmacodynamics, increased risk of infection, excess blood loss, and even organ failure. In turn, this creates worsened patient outcomes, prolonged hospitalization time, and increased medical expenses. Perioperative hypothermia has been reported to affect about 70% of surgical patients, thus establishing a need for an active warming system to prevent it from occurring. Through a needs assessment conducted in the Dominican Republic in Spring 2022, our team found that many healthcare systems across the country lack effective methods for maintaining patient core body temperature during surgeries. Current solutions used in the United States are expensive, non-reusable, and require manual controls, making it difficult to implement them in the Dominican Republic. Thus, based on our needs assessment and additional feedback from advisors, our team is currently developing a reusable, low-cost heated mattress element with an automatic control system to adjust mattress temperature in response to feedback from non-invasive core body temperature readings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is a need for a method of regulating patient core body temperature during surgery to prevent perioperative hypothermia and the ensuing complications that arise in low-resource hospitals. Thus, our team&rsquo;s mission is to provide a safe, effective, affordable, and reusable solution to allow healthcare systems across the Dominican Republic to effortlessly maintain patient core body temperature during surgery, resulting in improved patient outcomes and a reduced financial burden for both hospitals and patients. Specifically, our team strives to give operating rooms the ability to monitor core body temperature and maintain normothermia in patients during surgical procedures to prevent complications and discomfort that may arise as a result of perioperative hypothermia.</p>",

        "Description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the African nation of Ghana, lower-respiratory illnesses, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and diarrheal diseases account for 28% of deaths. All of these conditions can require extended intravenous fluid line (IV) use. Currently, nurses in hospitals and clinics in Ghana frequently go from bed to bed and manually count and re-calculate IV drip rates. In highly-crowded facilities, this can become an overwhelming and error-prone process.</span></p>\r\n<p>Team Flow is developing an efficient, user-friendly, and cost-effective method to accurately monitor and control the release intravenous fluids into patients. Our design considerations are grounded in our collaboration with an experienced emergency nurse at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, consultation with the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Center for Socially Engaged Design, and literature review. Our members have traveled abroad on M-HEAL&rsquo;s Service and Needs Assessment trip to Guatemala and the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Global Health Design Initiative trip to Ghana. These experiences granted insight on specific IV administration needs. We have used our findings to develop requirements, specifications, and an array of possible solutions for our IV drip monitoring and controlling solution and have narrowed our scope to several introductory solutions. We are currently working to produce low-fidelity prototypes of these solutions for preliminary testing.</p>",

        "Description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hybrid infant warmer design seeks to seamlessly combine kangaroo care (KC, also called skin-to-skin contact) and an external heating method into one device. There are three components which also provide the structure for the three subteams within The Initiative: bassinet, heating pad, and KC carrier. The bassinet houses the heating pad and is the standalone component of the device. The heating pad is the external heating method, and uses a resistive wire to generate heat and a control system to monitor heat output and maintain the system temperature at 37 degrees Celsius. The KC carrier is the wearable component that supports skin-to-skin contact. This component has been mostly developed, and is moving into a more marketing/business focused phase. These three components combine together into a cohesive device that aims to provide continuous warmth from two different heat sources. Through our hybrid infant warmer, we hope to globally eliminate mortality in low birth weight infants and provide families the opportunity to grow and thrive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LEARN MORE ON OUR WEBSITE:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mheal.engin.umich.edu/theinitiative\">http://mheal.engin.umich.edu/theinitiative</a></span></p>",

They are intellectual inquiry, community service, and self-governance.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#008000\"><strong>Intellectual inquiry</strong></span> is the first pillar of Telluride House. While all three pillars are appreciated equally, House members have consistently prided themselves on being the leaders and best in academics\r\n at the University of Michigan. This spirit appears in house life as well, where the intellectual inquiry manifests itself in the form of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pubspeaks (student presentations on any topic you are knowledgable on and wish)\r\n</li><li>Faculty Forums (similar to PubSpeaks, but for&nbsp;resident&nbsp;faculty) </li><li>Documentary screenings </li><li>Guest speakers and lecture series </li></ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#008000\"><strong>Community service</strong></span> is our second pillar. Through House projects, members of the Telluride House come together to make a difference in their community while also furthering the goals of the house and the\r\n association. Projects change from year to year, but have in the past included high school tutoring with Peace Neighborhood Center, working with political refugees in Detroit, or meal preparation at Food Gatherers.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#008000\">Self-governance</span></strong> is our third pillar at Telluride House. Our autonomy and practice of self-governance is a unique aspect of the house in comparison to other organizations at the University of Michigan. At\r\n Telluride House, self-governance means\u2026</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>House meetings, following Robert's Rules of Order, where students make administrative and budgetary decisions about the house processes\r\n</li><li>Committee work (Entertainment Committee, Logistics Committee, Advisory Committee, and Recruitment Committee.\r\n</li><li>Democratic development and selection of our community service project </li><li>Democratic selection of new house members and faculty guests, through application review for two, yearly cycles\r\n</li></ul>\r\n<p>Whether sitting in House meetings, working in a committee, or amending the by-laws, there are countless opportunities for and experiences with leadership and self-governance inherent in house life.</p>\r\n<p>Other benefits of the fellowship include (but are not limited to): Miscellaneous funds allocated for house improvements, events and outings, snacks and beverage preferences, streaming service and magazine subscriptions; exposure and mentorship from other\r\n members across diverse fields (Medicine, Law, Social Work, Engineering, Philosophy, History, etc.); freshly cooked meals from a personal chef, each day; fully furnished rooms; lifetime membership to the Telluride Association; opportunities for grants and funding\r\n associated with community service, thesis writing; a home gym, free parking/parking passes, and more.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

MI DNA Day provides a unique opportunity for high school students to meet and interact with young scientists, which often clarifies misconceptions of what a scientist looks like and breaks down barriers for students to follow scientific career paths. Scientist ambassadors also discuss their own ongoing research with students and share exciting career opportunities in science and biotechnology. Moreover, MI DNA Day allows early-career scientists to share their passion for science with students, fostering a spirit of public engagement leading to continued participation in science outreach throughout their careers.</p>\r\n<p>MI DNA Day takes its name from National DNA Day, which was created to commemorate the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 and the discovery of DNA&rsquo;s double helix in 1953. There are currently six other states with their own DNA Day programs, and we are ecstatic that Michigan is now on that growing list!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

The two main objectives of MEMSC is to educate the general public by hosting events and teaching courses on campus, and to spark interest in medicine as a whole. MEMSC currently has over 100 active members, 40+ of whom are licensed EMTs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MEMSC takes pride in providing quality education for our members and the greater U of M community. We believe that education is one of the most important aspects in developing responder skills, and one of the best ways to connect with our community on a more personal level. The Michigan EMS Club offers a range of educational classes such as Stop the Bleed, CPR/AED/BLS certification (through the AHA), and first aid courses to not only club members, but the greater Michigan community.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our club maintains a close relationship with Huron Valley Ambulance, a local private EMS agency, to facilitate the training, certification, and service of emergency medical technicians at Huron Valley Ambulance. Through HVA, we have certified approximately 15 EMTs through a dedicated course for U of M students. In addition, many EMS Club members have graduated from HVA's EMT program. We have also recently partnered with HVA to assist in a volunteer program in which non-certified members can assist EMTs at local U of M events and ride along in an ambulance to spark further interest in becoming a first responder.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the academic year, the club hosts monthly mass meetings where members get together to announce updates, collaborate on projects, and learn various prehospital skills. In these meetings, members can learn about research and further career opportunities. Many members now work on the M-RISE project, which aims to improve neurological outcomes following cardiac arrest, and the Toyota Drone Study, which seeks ways to improve the accessibility of EMS supplies in the field via the use of a drone. MEMSC also aims to increase career interest in meetings by bringing in a variety of guest speakers. Over the past 2 years, MEMSC has been pleased to host guest speakers with many agencies and individuals including: Ann Arbor Fire Department, HVA Dispatch, HVA Public Relations, HVA MICU paramedics, the Washtenaw/Livingston Medical Control Authority, Washtenaw County Hazmat, and multiple medical students completing residency in emergency medicine. Guest Speakers give presentations, offer advice, and bring in interactive medical equipment to spark greater interest in emergency medicine/EMS. Through the various opportunities we provide at MEMSC, we hope to build and foster interest in the prehospital field of medicine.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

You will likely find success if you try to get a group together in our main chat before game night. For a consistent Magic playgroup, checkout Magic: The Gathering Club.</p>\r\n<p>We also do not play any casual video-gaming like Jackbox, MarioKart or Super Smash Bros, although again these aren&rsquo;t off the table, they&rsquo;re just not our focus. You&rsquo;re more likely to find playgroups for these sorts of games games at the Casual Gaming Club.</p>\r\n<p>We also also don&rsquo;t play D&amp;D, Pathfinder, or role-playing campaign games. If that is something you are into, we recommend you check out the Tabletop Gaming Club!</p>\r\n<p>There are also dedicated clubs for chess and euchre, although we play both occasionally.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>What&rsquo;s your commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion?</em></p>\r\n<p>We have a dedicated DEI Committee whose goal is to help ensure all members and attendees feel safe and welcome at the club, and that will monitor an anonymous form for attendees to bring up any issues or concerns. In general the club is committed to keeping our community free of discrimination, harrassment, and bullying of any kind, in any form.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>It&rsquo;s free right?</em></p>\r\n<p>Mostly Yes! Showing up to weekly game nights and playing games is entirely free. We do ask that you pay a semester dues fee for certain events, usually anything where members bring food or use gas to drive somewhere, but also for participating in the biweekly tournaments. Dues are only $1-5 per semester, your choice. We also often accept bringing food or snacks for members as paying dues.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>What types of events?</em></p>\r\n<p>Most common is our once every three weekly tournaments, where we have small, optional, tournaments during regular game nights of different games with the winner earning pride and bragging rights. Other events we do during game nights include pot lucks, movie nights, de-stress days (coloring sheets &amp; nail painting), and holiday events like gift exchanges or costume contests. We also do stuff outside normal game nights like murder mystery nights put together by our members, or trips to places like cider mills or ice-skating rinks.</p>\r\n<p>The events committee is also very open, so you should speak up if you have any ideas or want to help run something!</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>Where do I ask other questions?</em></p>\r\n<p>You should send an email to <a href=\"mailto:gamesboard@umich.edu\">gamesboard@umich.edu</a> if you have specific questions. It&rsquo;ll reach everyone on the executive board.</p>\r\n<p>You could also read our constitution; it's linked below. It details the club's purpose and commitments and also the executive board structure and election procedure.</p>",

        "Description": "\r\n<p>Founded in 1998, Michigan Interactive Investments (MII) is a highly selective, leading undergraduate investment club at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. Each year, MII builds an investment portfolio with the goal of educating members about investing\r\n through interactive portfolio management. By maintaining a small, dedicated member base of approximately 60 undergraduate students, MII is able to effectively teach members about investing in a variety of equity, fixed income, and derivative securities. MII\r\n is unique in that we manage a $25,000 student-run portfolio. We have complete freedom over our investment strategies and asset classes, which include long/short equity, fixed income, and currencies.</p>\r\n<p>MII utilizes a multifaceted investment strategy involving both fundamental and quantitative analysis to invest in equities, options, and fixed income instruments. We take a disciplined approach to investing, focused on a medium-term outlook for attractive\r\n returns while preserving capital. Furthermore, we primarily use a bottom-up approach to source investment ideas, while also implementing top-down and quantitative screening strategies to identify opportunities that will outperform our S&amp;P 500 index benchmark.\r\n Additionally, we supplement this fundamental approach to investment selection with technical analysis to identify appropriate entry and exit points for our positions.</p>\r\n<p>MII also provides many resources to help members secure internship and full-time job placements, and hosts the Undergraduate Investment Conference (UIC) each fall. The UIC invites participants from over 20 of the top universities in the country for a featured\r\n stock pitch competition. The winner is awarded an approximately $3,000 grand prize, and the Conference includes a keynote speaker and the opportunity for students and corporate partners to meet and network.</p>\r\n<p>We pride ourselves on MII\u2019s three core pillars: Education, Investing, and Professional Development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Education</strong></p>\r\n<p>An important goal of MII is to educate members about investing and strengthen their knowledge of financial markets. This goal is comprised of three parts: First, new members have the opportunity to attend \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d sessions to learn the basics of\r\n investing, including how to source investments, value firms, and use financial data tools. Second, senior members make presentations during club meetings on more advanced topics, such as distressed debt investing, options valuation, and monetary policy. Third,\r\n every meeting features a market update that provides members with a better understanding of current economic conditions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Investing</strong></p>\r\n<p>MII builds a student run portfolio through a process in which members evaluate market sectors and pitch their best investment ideas. After the pitch, members vote on whether the security should be added to MII\u2019s portfolio. Profits are reinvested into the\r\n club, either towards growing the size of the portfolio or funding special events throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Professional Development</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our members are high performing. Graduating seniors have gone off into a variety of firms on both the sell side and buy side. The following list omits many firms, but on the sell side, members have gone on to work for Deutsche Bank, Evercore, Guggenheim\r\n Partners, Goldman Sachs, M. Klein &amp; Copmany, Moelis &amp; Company, Morgan Stanley, PJT Partners, The Raine Group, Royal Bank of Canada, and Rothschild Global Financial Advisory. On the buy side, members have worked for Ares, Apollo, Bridgewater, Insight Venture\r\n Partners, KKR, and Prudential Capital. As such, members can expect an extensive network that can open many doors during recruiting season.</p>\r\n",

MJAS is committed to contributing to the larger&nbsp;community of scholarship through our open-access website. MJAS accepts submissions&nbsp;from around the globe in the social sciences and humanities concerning Asian studies. Where opportunities exist, other journals confine their dialogues so narrowly as to include only one region, which consequently limits discussions that transcend regional&nbsp;boundaries. MJAS supports a broader scope of Asian culture, which consequently allows&nbsp;MJAS to accept more submissions and publish more frequently. Furthermore, it is the&nbsp;intention of MJAS to deepen appreciation and encourage interest into the rich and diverse&nbsp;cultures found in greater Asia, which is facilitated by affording students the venues in&nbsp;which to participate in the discussion.</p>\r\n<p>Besides appealing to those students who wish to publish, MJAS is useful for&nbsp;students at large in the field because MJAS archives its publications online, free to the&nbsp;public. With respect to MJAS&rsquo;s component on campus, MJAS wishes to manifest its&nbsp;presence through hosting various meetings: recruitment for both editors and would-be&nbsp;authors; mini-presentations from students preparing research projects; and appearances&nbsp;by professors to lecture or discuss their current research in the field of Asian studies.</p>",

All projects made with club supplies are donated to those in need. During weekly meetings, students knit, crochet, and converse for two hours. Meetings are not mandatory. The club provides all knitting/crocheting supplies (yarn, needles, crochet hooks, etc). To take a project home, a deposit of $5 for yarn and $5 for the needles/crochet hook ($10 total) is required. The money is returned after the completion of the project. This way, students who want to learn to knit/crochet can without needing to invest money in supplies. We accept students of all skill levels, from I-have-never-picked-up-yarn-before beginners to I-am-on-my-fifteenth-sweater experts. Although most projects are for charity donations, the club also welcomes folks who want to work on their own personal projects in a group setting. <br /><br />Why: Create goods to warm the local community and learn/expand crafty skills<br /><br />If you would like to set up a time to sign out materials, or if you want to donate items you have knit or crocheted (or items like food products or toiletries) to homeless shelters without joining Mknit, or for any other questions/comments/concerns, please feel free to contact Haley Seewald at hseewald@umich.edu or Sharona Berman at sharonab@umich.edu.&nbsp;</p>",

Many&nbsp;law&nbsp;students, and especially 1Ls, have no idea that&nbsp;plaintiff's&nbsp;firms are a viable career path in the first place.</p>\r\n<p>The Michigan Plaintiffs' Law Association (MPLA) is dedicated to fill this gap, supporting students who want to learn about, network with, and pursue careers at plaintiff-side law firms. MPLA will host educational events, job fairs, and maintain an up-to-date networking guide for all students. MPLA will also build community by connecting students to those with similar career interests.</p>",

We develop and execute our own research projects in the area of synthetic biology. Students have\r\n the opportunity to gain hands on experience in conducting scientific research, running a laboratory, engineering novel biological systems, fundraising, public outreach, leadership, and working as part of a multidisciplinary team. Every year, the team competes\r\n in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) jamboree competition in Paris, France.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>What is Synthetic Biology?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Synthetic Biology combines biology and engineering to design, construct, and test biological devices and systems. Combining these two disciplines allows us to better understand life, and use that understanding to benefit society.\r\n Synthetic Biology is distinct from Genetic Engineering in that the latter only alters existing genes, whereas the former utilizes existing, modified, and man-made genes to make life perform useful functions not normally found in nature. Through synthetic biology,\r\n it may be possible to solve some of the world\u2019s most challenging problems such as energy shortage, environmental pollution, and disease. However, we must be wary of potential safety and ethical issues along the way.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>What is iGEM?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">iGEM is an international undergraduate synthetic biology competition. In 2015, iGEM consisted of 259 teams and 2700 participants from all over the world. Every year, teams research, design, construct, and test a novel biological\r\n system. Students have at their disposal bits of DNA from the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological parts to help aid them in building their biological \u201cmachine\u201d. In addition, students are encouraged to build their own parts and develop new techniques to make\r\n life easier to engineer. Teams also help to increase awareness for synthetic biology through public outreach and analyze safety concerns as a part of the project design process. Projects are wide ranging and are divided into the following categories: Environment,\r\n Food and Nutrition, Energy, Foundational Advance, Health and Medicine, Information Processing, Manufacturing, Software Tools, and New Applications. For more information, see</span><a href=\"http://igem.org/Main_Page\">\r\n<span style=\"font-weight:400\">igem.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\">.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Who Can Join?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Any undergraduate student with an interest in synthetic biology and biological engineering is welcome to join! No previous experience is required. We also welcome members with extensive lab experience, especially with expertise\r\n in specific techniques, including human cell culture, Gibson assembly, and plasmid engineering. In addition, we always have places for students interested in mathematical modeling, business, programming, web design, and animation. Our team is composed of undergraduate\r\n students from a variety of majors, including (but not limited to) Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mathematics, Biophysics, Neuroscience, Microbiology, Philosophy, and Materials Science &amp; Engineering.\r\n We also have graduate students and faculty advisors from multiple colleges and departments on campus. Students will become acquainted with the theory and techniques during weekly meetings from February to the end of Winter Semester, at which point we will\r\n transition to working on the year\u2019s project, continuing into the Spring, Summer, and following Fall Semester, until our competition in late October. To join, applications start in the middle of January!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Note: Per iGEM rules, students over the age of 23 by March 31 may not perform work. They can however be advisors to the team. Students in a 5-year combined bachelor's/master's degree program who are not older than 23 are eligible\r\n to join!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

We are committed to establishing sustainable solutions to dismantle the barriers created by systems and furthering the academic success of menstruating people through advocacy programs that promote inclusivity and period equity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The University of Michigan chapter of Mission Menstruation believes that menstrual hygiene is a right, not a privilege. Academic institutions, upon being motivated by students, can address period poverty. With the belief that higher education institutions set the precedent for the way that many other institutions treat marginalized groups, working to educate and advocate for all students who menstruate on these campuses is the first step in making change for all people who have periods.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to higher academic institutions, such as but not limited to universities, colleges, and conservatories, etc, the Michigan State Legislature, like sixteen other states (New York, Maryland, Illinois, etc), should take action to implement funding or mandatory budgeting within public school districts for menstrual product dispensers and free products.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Menstrual Poverty impacts numerous groups, however research showcases that women of low-income are most affected, followed by low-income students on university campuses. According to the ACLU, &ldquo;a recent study demonstrated that two-thirds of low-income women in St. Louis could not afford menstrual products during the previous year, instead using cloth, rags, diapers, or paper as a substitute&rdquo; (ACLU, 2023). Advocating for legislation and supporting groups with the highest rates of menstrual equity, is the most important goal of our chapter at the University of Michigan.</p>",

In the past we've traveled everywhere from Hershey, Pennsylvania, to Richmond, Virginia, for meets.</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nGetting involved with MRun couldn't be easier--all you have to do is start showing up! During the fall we compete in Cross Country meets, and in the Winter/Spring, Track and Field. Beginning the first day of school in September we hold daily practices that\r\n offer a variety of running routes and distances. We meet outside the Central Campus Recreation Building (CCRB) on the walking bridge over Washtenaw Ave.&nbsp;every weekday at 4:15 PM where we will have usually a 3 mile, 5 mile, and 7 mile group go out for runs!\r\n We go to races about every other weekend during the Fall, and travel to locations anywhere from East Lansing, Michigan to Anderson, Indiana to Hershey, Pennsylvania. We also have a very successful Track and Field program so if you are not interested in long\r\n distance running, there are great opportunities for sprinting, jumping and throwing throughout the entire school year. There are track facilities available and practices and workouts for these events as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nHowever, the absolute best thing about MRun is that every practice, event, or anything is completely optional. You can come as much as you want! We have people who show up every day, and others once a month--it's entirely up to you!</p>\r\n<p><br>\r\nAs for social events and charity events, nobody does them better than MRun. During the beginning of the year, we have a bunch of events to help new members (especially Freshmen) get to know everyone in the club. We often joke that we're really just a giant\r\n &quot;MRun family&quot; and we've been told that we're one of the most welcoming clubs on campus. Keep in contact with the club&nbsp;as the school year gets closer so&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;know more specifically when these events are! There will be a mass meeting, social events, and many\r\n other fun things&nbsp;going on first semester to make the transition into the club as easy and fun as possible!</p>\r\n",

The scripts will feature four distinct characters, three locations, and limited stage directions and design suggestions. From there, four teams will each take on a different episode to design and produce. They will create an aesthetic that captures\r\n their interpretation of the world of the show, choosing locations and actors to complete their vision. In addition, each episode will include a custom, student-made theme song and poster which capture the team\u2019s artistic vision. Teams are not allowed to view\r\n other episodes before their episode is complete in an effort to make them as unique as possible. Our goal is to showcase a wide range of students\u2019 creativity and to build a network across departments in the process. Once a team has completed their episode,\r\n it will be aired on our Youtube channel, @MultiverseMedia, for anyone and everyone to view. By the end of the semester, we will have our completed series uploaded to our Youtube channel for everyone to share and appreciate.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">MM is established to share the talents of our students, create a network of artists, provide funded learning opportunities, and foster an environment that encourages curiosity and collaboration.

The club relies on volunteers to inquire about residents&rsquo; musical preferences and perform songs they would enjoy. All levels of expertise in instrument/vocals are welcome. MFD is a venue for volunteers to meet, form musical groups, and perform in front of an audience. UofM students mainly volunteer at the Brookdale and Orchard Hills care facilities in Ann Arbor, but we hope to expand to other facilities as well! Other sites are also available for those residing outside of Ann Arbor. Volunteer orientation is offered at the beginning of the semester and online workshops are provided throughout.</p>",

A key element of the program is the opportunity for admitted students and their parents to interact with current Michigan students (Campus Day Leaders). Our students can talk about their classes and the things they are involved with, share some of their experiences, and give families first-hand perspective about what it is like to be a student here. Besides providing campus tours and answering questions as panelists, they also assist with registration and helping our guests have a positive experience.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To learn more about Campus Day, come chat with us at Festifall or Northfest, or check out the video below!

One of our main initiatives is funding the construction of 1,000 schools in Honduras. This is the number of schools that will allow every child in Honduras to have access to a quality education. Since its founding, OTS has&nbsp;completed 67 schools.</p>\r\n<p>Honduras is the home of major cities like San Pedro Sula, where the murder rate and gang populations are high enough to consistently make them front page news on the New York Times and other prestigious US news sources. In 2009, Shin Fujiyama received a CNN Heroes award for his work in Honduras and appeared on shows like Larry King Live to explain the groundbreaking work One Thousand Schools was facilitating in Honduras.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>OTS is only able to build schools in Honduras through the fundraising and volunteering provided by high school and collegiate chapters in the United States.&nbsp;100% of&nbsp;funds&nbsp;donated by a chapter&nbsp;goes&nbsp;directly&nbsp;towards&nbsp;funding the construction of schools&nbsp;in Honduras. Members of those chapters have the opportunity to travel to Honduras and help build the schools they worked hard to raise money for. This is both an&nbsp;incredible&nbsp;learning experience for people and a great motivator for students to continue their fundraising efforts. OTS has a perfect safety record, and each member comes back with a changed perspective and enriched knowledge of life very different from theirs, as well as true hope for what can be accomplished through continued hard work in Honduras building schools and in the United States building chapters.</p>\r\n<p>The University of Michigan chapter of One Thousand Schools looks to build a community of passionate, strong-willed University of Michigan students who can help (1) build knowledge and awareness of the University of Michigan campus of the current issues being faced by Honduras and, as a consequence, how those issues translate to current border disputes and international politics, (2) raise money to build schools and donate school supplies to the communities working with SHH in Honduras, and (3) send volunteers on a safe and empowering service trip to Honduras at least once per year to participate in the building of these schools and to learn about the culture and people of Honduras.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This organization hopes to build a movement of young UM leaders with the collective goal of empowering and providing fundamental human needs to impoverished children and families in Honduras by promoting awareness through volunteerism and global responsibility.</p>",

PalMD connects medical students with shadowing opportunities to gain insight into palliative medicine in clinical settings and to establish relationships\r\n with healthcare providers in those settings. &nbsp;PalMD helps educate students on issues surrounding palliative and end-of-life care through a diverse range of experiences, such as through skills sessions and a dynamic lecture series. PalMD will additionally work\r\n with the medical school to incorporate formal education around palliative care concepts into the MD curriculum. Finally, PalMD works to help empower students to cope with difficult encounters on and off the wards through a palliative care lens, simultaneously\r\n helping to promote the wellness of the medical student community in facing such encounters.\r\n</span></p>\r\n",

Founded on the principle that access to quality healthcare should not be determined by geography or socioeconomic status, Project Resurge works to recover surplus medical supplies and devices from hospitals, clinics, and manufacturers across the United States and redirect them to free clinics and nonprofit healthcare organizations serving underserved populations &mdash; both domestically and internationally.</p>\r\n<p>Every year, millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of usable medical materials are discarded in the U.S. due to logistical oversupply, short-dated expiration, or minor packaging issues. At the same time, countless healthcare facilities around the world, and even within our own communities, lack the most basic resources to treat patients safely and effectively. Project Resurge operates at the intersection of sustainability and health equity, reducing medical waste while empowering healthcare providers in resource-scarce settings.</p>\r\n<p>We partner with hospitals, healthcare networks, and student volunteers to collect and inventory these supplies, ensuring they meet safety standards before distributing them to verified recipient organizations. Our recent collaborations have supported free health clinics in Detroit, refugee health initiatives, and global medical missions &mdash; including direct shipments to war-torn and disaster-stricken areas such as Syria.</p>\r\n<p>Through these efforts, we aim not only to deliver vital medical materials but also to foster a culture of social responsibility within the healthcare system. Project Resurge is more than a redistribution network &mdash; it is a movement of students, physicians, and community members dedicated to reimagining the lifecycle of medical resources and reshaping access to care for those who need it most.</p>",

As a student-run organization here at the University of Michigan, our primary focus is providing mentoring to all ages of our Hispanic Latinx Community here in Ann Arbor/Ypsilanti. We have three different programs within our organization: Pre-K, K-12, and Adult.&nbsp;<br /><br />What we do:<br /><br />Our Pre-Kindergarten program focuses on younger children and helping them prep for school. Our Pre-K program uses lots of resources from the AADL such as games, children's books, and online learning games.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second is our K-12 program. In this program we focus on helping the kids with the schoolwork that they bring with them to our tutoring sessions. The amount of work they have varies by student, therefore tutors are also ready to work with their students on the subjects they may have a more difficult time with... extra practice is always good!&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, we also have an adult ESL program. This program focuses on helping parents and other community members with their English. For this program, we like to have tutors who are proficient in Spanish.&nbsp;<br /><br />With all three of our programs, we pair one or two students with a tutor. We welcome anyone who wishes to be a tutor or a student with us. We especially love getting new tutors as we have a long list of students awaiting a placement. The bigger our organization, the more good we do.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\"><strong>If you are interested in joining PALMA, </strong><strong>contact Victoria Mago (vicmago@umich.edu.edu) or Ellen McDonough (ellenmcd@umich.edu)!</strong></span></span></p>",

Our organization is built on the belief that science communication should be a conversation,\r\n and not scientists lecturing audiences about their work. Our goal is to support researchers in engaging in this conversation.</p>\r\n<p>Public dialog on scientific ideas benefits both the public and the institution of science. However, researchers must be able to communicate their work and its implications in a way that is accessible and meaningful to a broad audience. Researchers have a\r\n variety of motivations for engaging with different public audiences such as informing policy, medical and ethical decisions, and enhancing science education. Likewise, scientific research is improved by incorporating diverse perspectives and experiences from\r\n the public. RELATE aims to bridge these communities through a unique program structure which pairs communications training with practice.</p>\r\n<p>As a part of RELATE, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics researchers hone their communication skills in an intensive workshop with instruction and feedback from communications experts. To complete their training, these researchers put their\r\n newly refined skills into action by communicating with a broad audience in a series of community engagement events about the process of science, research progress, and issues in their fields.</p>\r\n<p>By helping STEM researchers develop stronger communication skills and facilitating an active dialogue between researchers and different public communities, RELATE seeks to create an environment for positive and significant public engagement related to scientific\r\n issues.</p>\r\n",

By submitting/uploading a project, you have the opportunity to build teamworking skills and share your coding skills with the club. If you want to start a project, email a one page proposal to sc2-officers@umich.edu.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https://sc2umich.github.io/documents/projects/proposals/proposal_example.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Project Proposal Template</span></a></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Workshops and Presentations</strong></span><br>\r\n<div>The workshops and presentations focus of our club also encourages contribution from the club body. Any member can submit a workshop or presentation, and then, they can teach the club a new skill using a workshop or introduce new ideas through a presentation.\r\n This aspect of our club can be used by our members to improve their presentation skills, increase their knowledge of a particular subject, or practice a presentation for an important event. Additionally, we invite professors and other experts in scientific\r\n computing to present their research, allowing our members to connect to the larger scientific computing community.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqG3noNGf0cRo7rd_nV-NDwCRZa8lwd1xmzpQbBop3bENoSw/viewform?usp=sf_link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sumbit a workshop</span></a></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Events</strong></span><br>\r\n<div>We host various internal events as a club, such as social and outreach events, but we are also interested in participating in many external events, such as hackathons and data challenges. Participating in these events individually can be challenging since\r\n they can demand hours or days of your time or even require registration fees. We provide the resources to make this process easier. We set up a system allowing you to create competition teams open to the club and request funding for registration fees, making\r\n it easier to participate in these events and gain the credentials associated with them.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Community</strong></span><br>\r\n<div>Besides the activities we list above, we also want to provide a space for those interested in scientific computing to meet one another, share experiences, and possibly collaborate.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Leadership Structure</strong></span><br>\r\n<div>Finally, This club has a robust leadership structure that allows many members to participate in leading the club to the degree that is suitable to them. The leadership is organized into six committees: an Executive Committee and five task-based committees.\r\n The Executive Committee can have at least 9 positions, and the task-based committees are composed of four members. Graduate student members may be elected to positions on the Executive Committee, and any club member may be nominated to a position on the task-based\r\n committees by the respective committee chair.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
        "Summary": "This club provides a community for those interested in computer simulations, high-performance computing, or other software related to science. We engage in club programming projects, host workshops and presentations, compete in hackathons, and more!",

        "Description": "<p>Sling Health is a student-run group that facilitates bio-engineering design and entrepreneurship on campus. This incubator brings together student teams from various backgrounds to address medical issues and improve healthcare. Teams are made up of health focused students, such as medical, engineering, law, and business students, to bring their expertise to the problems facing healthcare today. Our four objectives for what students will attain as a part of Sling Health at UM are as follows.</p>\r\n<p>1. To learn about medical entrepreneurship in a multidisciplinary context, with engineering, medical business, and legal perspectives, while gaining team leadership and technical experience.</p>\r\n<p>2. To join a fast-growing national network that has produced many prototypes, patents, and startups.</p>\r\n<p>3. To work with other bright students and faculty on a problem of interest with the supporting resources.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. Develop novel devices and software applications targeting unmet clinical needs.</p>\r\n<p>Our 2024-25 season will kickoff with the Sling Health Problem Day on September 24th from 6-8 PM at the Danto Auditorium at the Frankel Cardiovascular Center. Dinner will be provided!</p>\r\n<p>Please RSVP here for the event:&nbsp;https://forms.gle/X3GrBJAC9rdHcbyp7</p>\r\n<p>We are also looking for students to serve as team leaders this year where you will pitch a healthcare problem that you are looking to solve at the Problem Day event. There is no entrepeneurship experience required to serve as a team leader and we can help you find potential healthcare problems to tackle if you do not have an idea in mind. This is a great opportunity to get involved in entrepeneurship in a low stakes environment with $1,000 of gauranteed funding for all teams!</p>\r\n<p>Team Leader Application (due Sept 15):&nbsp;https://forms.gle/u7H1iswTsJ9kvbxY8</p>",

As well as creating diversity on campus and in the workplace and providing opportunities for members to give back to their communities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">In addition to the national mission, the SASE-UM chapter has a mission to establish an active presence of Asians in engineering and science on campus and engage in the community by emphasizing each individual's technical skills. Furthermore, we hope to strengthen the leadership and communication skills of our members to better prepare them in the business world and their careers.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"width: 665px;\">Founding</h3>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">The University of Michigan chapter of SASE was founded in October 2010, and has since gained support from various departments in the university. Before a SASE chapter was started at the University of Michigan, there were many other ethnic scientific and engineering societies, but none that that truly represented those of Asian heritage. It was on this basis that the University of Michigan chapter of SASE was founded as well as the entire nationwide SASE community. The national SASE community was founded in 2007 by 10 Proctor and Gamble interns. Today, the SASE community spans across many colleges nationwide.</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Facebook:&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/sase.umich</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Instagram:&nbsp;https://www.instagram.com/sase.michigan/</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Slack:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">um-student-sase.slack.com</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Website:&nbsp;http://www.umich.edu/~sase/</p>",

SRP was founded in 2013 in response to the tremendous need for free, high-quality representation\r\n and support for students facing suspension and expulsion hearings in southeast Michigan. In all of our activities, SRP seeks to keep students in school, learning, and out of the criminal justice system. Members of our organization become talented interviewers\r\n and oral advocates. They also develop zeal and cultural humility.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to advocating for students in disciplinary hearings, SRP advocates also:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>provide targeted special education support for students facing disciplinary exclusion due to disability \u00adrelated behaviors;\r\n</li><li>engage in non-\u00adhearing advocacy in disciplinary matters; </li><li>host and attend events designed to educate the university and larger community about the school\u00ad-to-\u00adprison pipeline in Michigan and best practices to oppose it; and\r\n</li><li>challenge institutional threats to educational opportunities for children. </li></ul>\r\n<p>A centerpiece of SRP is its interdisciplinary advocacy, combining the strengths of education, social work, public policy, and law in order to promote positive outcomes for Michigan\u2019s youth. Our advocates are valued for their contributions to student advocacy,\r\n whether that be training in client interviewing, statutory research, or helping families access community resources. For this reason, each hearing advocacy is comprised of students from each discipline, insofar as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Since our founding, SRP has partnered with the Student Advocacy Center of Michigan (SAC) in the shared drive to end the school\u00ad-to\u00ad-prison pipeline in the state. SAC is a non\u00adprofit educational advocacy organization headquartered in Ypsilanti, Michigan.\r\n SRP receives its referrals through SAC\u2019s intake process, and our case advocacy is supervised by an SAC attorney. Each organization supports the other in their collective youth justice efforts.</p>\r\n",

STARS is aware that many affinity groups address racial problems on campus through advocacy and events, but think it would be advantageous to form a student organization that is not an affinity group dedicated to this topic. This group would appreciate and welcome intersectionality and diverse viewpoints, as other identities that we hold impact racial issues at the law school.&nbsp;</p>",

In 2004, the AATU ceased operations due to a lack of funding, however the organization was restarted in August of 2023. The original iteration of the AATU advocated for tenants' rights, provided a tenant counseling hotline, and directed actions to support legislation favorable to tenants at the city and state levels.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AATU was originally formed to lead a citywide rent strike starting in 1968. At the time, about 90% of rental units in Ann Arbor were not up to code. Similar to today, the quality of rental housing was low and the prices high. The rent strike, which lasted two years, involved tenants paying their rent into an offshore escrow account rather than to the landlord. Landlords would receive their rent from the account if they either brought the rental unit up to code or agreed to collective bargaining with the tenants union. Collective bargaining in this context would entail a negotiation between the landlord and a Tenants Union representative over the provisions in the leasing contracts for all tenants renting from that particular landlord. This differs from the normal process of the landlord negotiating individually with each tenant. The strategy was successful in </span><a href=\"https://aadl.org/node/201294\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some instances</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but many landlords ultimately did not agree to collective bargaining. Nonetheless, the AATU was able to significantly improve the quality of rental units in Ann Arbor and challenge the power of landlords both at rental complexes and in the city and state government.&nbsp;</span></p>",

This will encompass participation in monthly seminars investigating the multi-factorial reality of poverty, observation and evaluation of successful community programs, and service experiences at multiple locations in the Southeastern Michigan. Students who are accepted into this program will be required to participate in community service experiences of their choosing, which we will then reflect upon as a group. Allowing students to choose their own experiences will allow for greater commitment on the individual student&rsquo;s part, as well as greater breadth of discussion.</p>\r\n<p>Small discussion-based seminars will be scheduled monthly.&nbsp; They are designed to supplement the service work, avoiding theory and abstraction, and focusing rather on the grounded, tangible knowledge and experiences of students and visiting speakers. For these seminar discussions a meal will be provided to be shared with the guest expert in an effort to encourage a discussion style format where the participants will be better able to ask questions and engage in the exchange of information.</p>\r\n<p>HESP will also complete site visits to community-engaged organizations such as FQHCs and other community organizing centers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Site-visits are essential for our members to gain exposure to successful organizations that are working towards improving health equity. Survey data from previous years shows site visits to be one of the most impactful aspects of HESP.&nbsp;Site-visits also facilitate networking and mentorship between students and administrators at the facilities. Such relationships have developed into research projects and independent site-visits from HESP members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, student members will participate in volunteerism through their own efforts or through the medical school's existing programs.</p>",

Also, quantitative finance is very similar to tech in the regard that it is not a job that is meant to stress you out or have you overworked - many find that the industry is much more relaxed and collaborative than it gives off!</p>\r\n<p>Through a rigorous and thorough education department, an extensive focus on networking with peers within and out of the club, recruiters, and companies, and a strong sense of community, we seek to enable everyone at UMich to enter the world of quantitative finance.</p>\r\n<p>A few of our offerings are as follows:</p>\r\n<p>- Hundreds of interview preparation materials</p>\r\n<p>- Pdfs of several industry \"must-reads\"</p>\r\n<p>- Multiple social events each month to tighten bonds and a sense of community within the club</p>\r\n<p>- Strategic partnerships with similar clubs and in industry leaders</p>\r\n<p>- Opportunities to expand your network to interns and full-timers at the best companies in industry (as well as recruiters)</p>\r\n<p>Even if you don't know if \"quant\" is right for you, we encourage you to ask yourself:</p>\r\n<p>- Do I like solving challenging problems in creative ways?</p>\r\n<p>- Am I very analytical?</p>\r\n<p>- Do I like strategic games like poker and chess?</p>\r\n<p>If the answer to any of these is yes, we encourage you to apply to Traders at Michigan because you may be destined for this field and you just don't know it yet!</p>",

Rather,&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;fraternity was established as a means to create a close-knit community of like-minded men that focused their efforts on&nbsp;<em>several</em>&nbsp;core\r\n aspects of life and strived to achieve the perfect balance between work, play, and service to the community.</p>\r\n<p>So what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Triangle Fraternity? At the University of Michigan, Triangle is a community of various students studying technical programs, such as engineering, biology, neuroscience, and architecture, centered around its chapter home and its core values.\r\n The members strive for the balanced lifestyle and forge lifelong friendships along the way. At the national level, Triangle Fraternity is an organization that seeks to develop men as leaders and create a widespread network of individuals dedicated to personal\r\n growth, brotherhood, and their professional interests.</p>\r\n<p>Each member joins Triangle for a different reason, but&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;member is able to find an atmosphere which fosters friendship and academic, social, and professional growth.</p>\r\n",

        "Description": "\r\n<p><strong>Interested in joining the team for 2025-2026? Fill out our interest form for information about our mass meeting and to sign up for coffee chats (free coffee!) with team officers:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/MMrAUHdfYhWRmkTL7\">https://forms.gle/MMrAUHdfYhWRmkTL7</a></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">We are an engineering team that designs, fabricates, and programs a robotic surface vessel that can navigate obstacles and perform tasks on the open water all on its own with no human interaction. Working year-round, the team\r\n competes internationally against other autonomous boats every March in RoboNation's RoboBoat Competition in Sarasota, Florida. Last season, we took home 4th out of 30 teams (best from the US!), and won several awards - but this year, we're chasing the top.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our team is multidisciplinary, and has no barrier to entry - we encourage students from all different schools and colleges within the university with only a persistent curiosity and good spirits required. The goal of the team is to create a functional, efficient\r\n vessel while seeking out opportunities for learning and growth every step of the way.&nbsp;Bringing up questions and proposing adjustments are encouraged, as they help make a more cohesive team and a better overall product.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The team is split up into five main subteams: Mechanical, Electrical, AI, Advanced Capabilities, and Business.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The mechanical team designs and fabricates a new boat for competition each year, employing naval architecture and marine engineering principles to create resilient, waterproof hulls that can cut smoothly through the water, and a deck and superstructure that\r\n can support and protect the electronics housed within the boat. In addition, they provide support for mounting sensors onboard and help facilitate the boat's testing in the water in the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory. Students majoring in ME, NAME, ISME,\r\n RE, and many others can find their interests here!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our electrical team is responsible for all electronics onboard - they ensure that the boat has a reliable, safe electrical system capable of supporting the immense amount of software running on deck, which is crucial to our overall performance. Every year,\r\n they build a full computer capable of supporting our AI team's work, designing printed circuit boards (PCBs), and protecting everything in secure housing. Students majoring in Computer and Electrical Engineering, as well as those interested in integrated systems\r\n in general, are encouraged to join!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The AI team develops all of the boat's software, and consists of the bulk of our team - without them, our boat would simply be a sitting duck. Their team consists of multiple parts - Computer Vision, Task Planning, and Navigation/Controls. All of these make\r\n up a software pipeline that work in tandem to perceive tasks and obstacles, plan paths around or toward them, and navigate the boat according to that path. Computer Science and Robotics Engineering students, as well as anyone interested in programming, is\r\n encouraged to join!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Advanced Capabilities team is an interdisciplinary unit that works closely with other subteams to develop task-specific hardware and software that can vary wildly with the changes in competition challenges every year. Members work on specific mechanisms,\r\n and are responsible for everything from CAD, electronics, and embedded software, while ensuring integration with other subteams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the Business team is what holds our team together - not only do they coordinate the finances and budget for the team, working to secure private sponsorships and manage funding, but they also market the team to the rest of the university and the world.\r\n Through outreach events, interaction with other teams and even some of our competition, to managing our technical documentation and presentation material for both our judges and the sponsors we work with, they ensure a unified brand and a team that can continue\r\n to reach new heights. While STEM students are highly encouraged, the business team also offers endless opportunities for those from any other discipline - everything from art, to writing, to business, to management is crucial to our team's success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our team welcomes all, and encourages opportunities to learn, grow, and build the most important ship of all - friendship!&nbsp;If you have an interest in helping create an unmanned vessel, come join the team!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>More information can be found at <a title=\"UM::Autonomy\" href=\"https://www.umautonomy.com\">\r\nwww.umautonomy.com</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"UM::Autonomy 2023 Team Video\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxFV9WLaQ88\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxFV9WLaQ88</a></p>\r\n",

In partnership with the University of Michigan Law School, Physicians for Human Rights and community organizations such as Freedom House, this&nbsp;student-led initiative empowers medical professionals and students to advocate&nbsp;for victims and survivors of human rights violations and serve as a voice for those who have limited access to such resources. Our focus is to facilitate inter-professional collaboration between <em>pro bono</em> legal and medical providers to conduct forensic evaluations and medical affidavits for asylum, human trafficking, and other cases that have experienced human rights abuses. We also seek to educate providers and medical&nbsp;students to recognize and advocate for victims of torture and abuse in clinical practice. Our goal is to establish and work with a consortium of providers in the Midwest to provide&nbsp;forensic&nbsp;medical evaluations to support legal cases. Working closely with the national organizing Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), the University of Michigan Law School, and Freedom House Detroit, members&nbsp;invest in projects that challenge the boundaries of the physician&rsquo;s role and act to protect human rights both in the United States and abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Evaluation requests should be submitted via email to UMACevaluations@med.umich.edu.</p>\r\n<p>For general inquiries, please email umasylumcollaborative@med.umich.edu</p>",

In our writing, our artistic expression, and our events,&nbsp;<em>What the F&nbsp;</em>is dedicated to a form of feminism that values intersectionality and inclusively. We recognize that individuals face oppression through multiple different facets of their identity, whether it be through gender, race, nationality, sexual identity, religion, ability, etc. We aim to support, to heal, and to express ourselves freely.

Other water sport enthusiasts (canoe, SUP, etc.) are welcome to join too, but our instruction experience and gear are primarily focused on whitewater kayaking.</p>\r\n<p>While whitewater kayaking is our primary focus, we also offer other nature-related activities (like camping road trips and kayak sledding) depending on member interest/availability and weather.</p>\r\n<p>WWKC is a voluntary organization administered by the University of Michigan. Non-student members are welcome; however, the club must maintain at least 50% student membership to be a UM club sport. Because of university policy, we are not allowed to have non-student participants under the age of 18.</p>\r\n<p>We are working to update our information on Maize Pages. Please disregard the Meeting information within the constitutions; we do not currently meet at NCRB pool. We will send out information on weekly kayaking sessions, weekend trips and winter pool sessions at the start of the next semester. We usually don't offer any sessions or trips during the summer, but if you're hoping to kayak and looking for a group to join, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/emu-paddlers\">Michigan Adventure Paddlers</a> is a great option (and we can also send you other resources if you'd like)</p>\r\n<p>If you'd like to participate in club activities please join through Maize Pages and/or reach out to Jon (jdlowry@umich.edu) and Liem (liem@umich.edu). They're also happy to answer any questions if you're curious about the club or whitewater kayaking. You can also reach out to Avik (abmondal@umich.edu) and Christina (chendren@umich.edu), but they are very busy with pursuing PhDs.</p>\r\n<p>The most up-to-date social media below that we still use is our Instagram page @wwkayakmichigan.</p>\r\n<p>If you're passionate about kayaking and would be interested in helping the club (with instruction, student outreach, etc.), send us an email!&nbsp;</p>",

We highly encourage any of our members to try as many of these different positions as possible, and even allow our members to pitch new shows. The best part... no experience is required! We will teach you everything you will need to know :)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>WOLV-TV prides itself on professional development; whether interested in a career in sports, news, or entertainment, we offer workshops, talkbacks, and events with professionals in the industry.

Young Americans for Freedom is a project of Young America's Foundation, which is a national non-profit organization which was founded in 1960 to develop and promote conservative ideas among our nation's young people. While the YAF chapter at the University of Michigan was originally founded decades ago, the chapter was reorganized in 2015 after being dormant for several years. Since then, the chapter has hosted the likes of Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, and other speakers, in addition to weekly meetings, tabling, and social events. Our chapter also won YAF Chapter of the Year in 2019.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>What We Do</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas on campus through weekly meetings, speaking events, tabling, and social events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Meetings</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter meetings are held on Tuesdays at 7 p.m. in Room D of the Michigan League. We typically discuss current issues and important conservative ideas as a group. Board members often give presentations on specific topics of interest to spur a deeper dive into the issues. Members and non-members are free to join us at our meetings to discuss the issues and meet fellow conservatives.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Speakers</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas through speaking events each year. Our speaking events (typically one each semester) are designed to give U of M students the opportunity to hear from some of the most prominent and cutting edge conservative voices, as well as ask questions during the Q&amp;A portion of the event. Our events are always free and usually live streamed on YAF's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yafumich.com/youtube.com/YAFTV\">Youtube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Tabling</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas on campus by tabling in support of various topics several times each semester. We typically set up a table on the Diag or in Mason Hall to discuss conservative ideas with students. We also take part in YAF's 9/11 Never Forget Memorial each September, where we place 2,977 flags on the Diag to honor those who lost their lives on September 11th.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Social Events</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter also hosts social events to have fun together as a chapter. We typically hang out several times each semester to play paintball, walk around the Arb, go ice skating at Yost, or enjoy a bonfire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conferences</strong></p>\r\n<p>Members from our chapter typically attend several YAF conferences throughout the year. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yafumich.com/yaf.org/events\">yaf.org/events&nbsp;</a>for more information</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text-content\">\r\n<h3><strong>The Sharon Statement</strong></h3>\r\n<p>In this time of moral and political crises, it is the responsibility of the youth of America to affirm certain eternal truths.</p>\r\n<p>We, as young conservatives, believe:</p>\r\n<p>That foremost among the transcendent values is the individual&rsquo;s use of his God-given free will, whence derives his right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force;</p>\r\n<p>That liberty is indivisible, and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom;</p>\r\n<p>That the purpose of government is to protect those freedoms through the preservation of internal order, the provision of national defense, and the administration of justice;</p>\r\n<p>That when government ventures beyond these rightful functions, it accumulates power, which tends to diminish order and liberty;</p>\r\n<p>That the Constitution of the United States is the best arrangement yet devised for empowering government to fulfill its proper role, while restraining it from the concentration and abuse of power;</p>\r\n<p>That the genius of the Constitution&mdash;the division of powers&mdash;is summed up in the clause that reserves primacy to the several states, or to the people, in those spheres not specifically delegated to the Federal government;</p>\r\n<p>That the market economy, allocating resources by the free play of supply and demand, is the single economic system compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government, and that it is at the same time the most productive supplier of human needs;</p>\r\n<p>That when government interferes with the work of the market economy, it tends to reduce the moral and physical strength of the nation; that when it takes from one man to bestow on another, it diminishes the incentive of the first, the integrity of the second, and the moral autonomy of both;</p>\r\n<p>That we will be free only so long as the national sovereignty of the United States is secure; that history shows periods of freedom are rare, and can exist only when free citizens concertedly defend their rights against all enemies;</p>\r\n<p>That the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these liberties;</p>\r\n<p>That the United States should stress victory over, rather than coexistence with, this menace; and</p>\r\n<p>That American foreign policy must be judged by this criterion: does it serve the just interests of the United States.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",
