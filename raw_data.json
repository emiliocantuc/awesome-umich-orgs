We are part of a national network of outstanding students, faculty, and professionals that sponsor events at many major universities. We also provide other opportunities for our members to flourish professionally and personally, and our members span worldwide and are united at basic convictions discussing the United State's role in the world. Our activities include:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Hamiltonian Statecraft</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Every student who applies to be an author will have an opportunity to get published on an issue in international relations and national security on a semesterly basis. Under the guidance of our Editor in Chief, members would receive close mentorship and active feedback on five possible entry formats: research paper, academic essay, Op-Ed, policy proposal, and book review. Additionally, students would have the opportunity to crosslist the publication with the national organization&rsquo;s journal, The Hamiltonian.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Hamiltonian Diplomacy</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Selected AHS members will compete in bisemesterly conferences per year for any of the following: Model UN, Model NATO, Model European Union, and Model Arab League. The delegation team would be led by the Director of Academic Programs, who would assist and coach delegates in successfully representing our Chapter to the national conference.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Speaker events and panels</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The speaker panels/events provide students an understanding of what American leadership has achieved. They address complex global issues from multiple perspectives with a goal to promote critical thinking. Speakers include former Secretaries of State, Secretaries of Defense, Directors of CIA, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Senior Fellows at esteemed think tanks and civil societies in Washington D.C.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>National Programming:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The national charter runs intensive programs for students to educate skills and knowledge for foreign affairs and national security careers. Members of the AHS would have the opportunity to engage with scholars in foreign policy and national security through expert panels, chapter training, professional development, and networking opportunities. These include the National Defense Fellowship run by the AHS and the Ronald Reagan Institute, the Hamilton National Fellowship that provides grants for summer internships in Washington, DC, and book series that provide a wide perspective to foreign affairs, defense, and economic policy.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Wargaming and policy simulations</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The wargames and policy simulations, designed by RAND Corporation, would serve to educate our membership on American grand strategy, defense policy, and budgeting forward engagement. Led by the Director of Policy, wargames and policy simulations would be run on a monthly basis on various formats and various international crisis scenarios to provide a firsthand experience in managing and executing U.S. foreign and defense policy abroad.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, AHS stands for basic principles in U.S. foreign policy that include:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A conviction, rooted in the history of the last century, that the world is a better, safer, and more prosperous place when the United States is willing and able to lead. And a commitment to maintaining the moral authority and material strength on which that leadership rests.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An appreciation that the world remains a dangerous place in which our power must be exercised with prudence, and where the primary threats to our security come from states that deny freedom to their own people and from non-state actors who embrace hatred and violence.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clear recognition that, in such a world, our true friends and reliable partners are other democratic nations with whom we share an enduring commonality of values, and not simply a temporary convergence of interests.</span></li>\r\n</ul>",

With an active focus in social, philanthropic, and sisterhood activities, the young women of Alpha Chi strive to make an impact in our community and the Michigan campus as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>Each one of our young women is unique. With members from the east to the west coast, and even overseas, our various backgrounds help to enrich the experiences of every Alpha Chi. From an academic standpoint, diversity continues to shape our house with members pursuing degrees in Literature, Science, and the Arts, Engineering, Art and Design, Nursing, Business, and much more. Members of the Theta Chapter not only uphold their academic integrity, but they also strive to uphold the other principles of an Alpha Chi as well such as personal development and their leadership abilities. Our young women are active in over 80 organizations on campus ranging from A Cappella groups to club sports and many hold prominent leadership positions throughout campus.</p>\r\n<p>Although each member is different and we are a diverse chapter, the presence of Alpha Chi Omega and the sisterhood that it offers shape our college experiences in a similar way. Activities such as painting &ldquo;the rock,&rdquo; all chapter lunches,&nbsp;as well as picnics in the Arb, and philanthropy events help bring together the different pledge classes of the Theta Chapter.</p>\r\n<p>Giving back to the Ann Arbor community is one of the most rewarding aspects of being an Alpha Chi at Michigan. Because the Women&rsquo;s Center of Southeastern Michigan is located right here in Ann Arbor, we are lucky enough to have members volunteer their time weekly to help women and children in need. It is in this way that our members are fortunate enough to personally see their hard philanthropic work be put to use. We take pride in philanthropic endeavors throughout the year and encourage our members to pursue community service regularly. We regularly participate in other sororities&rsquo; and fraternities&rsquo; philanthropies as well as in the University-wide Greek Week to support various philanthropic organizations in the area.</p>\r\n<p>The Theta Chapter of Alpha Chi Omega truly is &ldquo;The Michigan Difference.&rdquo; &nbsp;To all of the alumnae, please feel free to contact me at axoumichpresident@gmail.com for any information about our chapter! We would love to hear your success stories and about how the bonds that we will create today extend beyond these four years at Michigan.</p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\r\n<p>Chapter President</p>",

        "Description": "<p>The Alpha Delta Phi Fraternity was founded in 1832 at Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, by Samuel Eells (1810-1842). While founded as a literary society, it evolved into one of the most distinguished of the original American college fraternities. It has retained its focus on its literary roots, by attracting only the best students at only the best colleges and universities in Canada and the United States. A majority of its chapters are leaders on their respective campuses, where some of their houses have been designated architectural or historic landmarks. The Alpha Delta Phi experience has helped a disproportionate number of its 50,000 lifelong members to become top leaders in industry, government, education, and religion.<br /><br />The Peninsular Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi welcomes alumni brothers, undergraduate brothers and others who are interested in learning more about this distinguished brotherhood. Feel free to contact us to learn more about the history and traditions of Alpha Delta Phi and our chapter.</p>",

On Friday, April 10, 2009, the Epsilon Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. reached its 100th year in existence. This milestone was not only an accomplishment for the chapter, but for the entire University of Michigan community, the city of Ann Arbor, and the Michigan District and Midwestern Region of Alpha of Alpha.<br /><br />Ever clinging to the motto &ldquo;Nothing Questionable is Accepted,&rdquo; we at Epsilon chapter<br />continue the tradition of excelling scholastically, athletically, and socially. A testament to this truth, Epsilon Chapter boasts 10+ Phi Beta Kappa Members, 10+ Athletic All-Americans as recently as 2000, and a steady stream of honors, awards, and accolades for service. We strive through comradeship to attain the noble goal of a balance between social and academic life and have proven wrong those who declare that both of these phase of existence are incompatible and mutually inhibitory.<br /><br />We understand and recognize that past is prologue to the future and that an intimate familiarity with and reverence for what has gone on before is both central and essential to our ongoing development and survival. Brotherhood, scholarship, leadership, and service, the four principles upon which the Jewels founded Alpha Phi Alpha, continue to be the guiding values of Epsilon. It can be said that fraternity life in Alpha Phi Alpha has shown us that the ideals to which we aspire are worth striving for and that Epsilon chapter continues to be a &lsquo;rendezvous for fraters, a sanctuary for scholars, and a haven for gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>",

        "Description": "\r\n<p><em>&quot;Our Fraternity will continue to offer America what it most needs -- future leaders who care, who want to become part of the solution, who know they can make a difference, and who realize that service to others is a value worth sharing.&quot;</em><br>\r\n<br>\r\n--&nbsp;Gerald A Schroeder, Past National President, 1990-1994<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlpha Phi Omega's service program is four-fold: our projects provide service to the campus, service to the community, service to the chapter (and APO as an organization), and service to the nation. We acheive this goal by providing a wide variety of projects.\r\n Some of our most popular projects are the UM vs. OSU Blood Battle, Knitwits, Crafts for Motts, and Passing Notes.</p>\r\n<p>The rush process for Alpha Phi Omega is held at the beginning of the fall and winter semesters, and at these times the chapter will hold mass meetings to help inform students about the organization. While this phase of joining the organization is called\r\n &quot;rush&quot;, it is not very similar to the rush you would participate in for Greek houses -- it is extremely easy and non-competitive.</p>\r\n<p>During the week of our mass meeting, we hold a series of rush events, which are open to anyone interested in joining APO (these often include&nbsp;service projects, happy hours, and&nbsp;fellowship&nbsp;events). These give you a chance to get to know members of APO and\r\n see if it's something you'd like to be a part of. There is no &quot;bid&quot; selection - anyone who wants to be a member of APO can join.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anyone interested in APO may attend a Pledge Initiation Ceremony to become an APO Pledge Member. The Pledge Initiation Ceremony will be at the beginning of each semester, after rush has ended.</p>\r\n<p>Your first semester in APO will be full of opportunities to learn about the organization and find your place in it. That is the essence of the pledge process. You will undergo an initiation ritual, and be assigned to a &quot;big&quot; - an older APO member who will\r\n answer any questions you have and help you figure out the ins and outs of APO. You will attend all the same meetings as the Active Brothers do, and you will also attend pledge meetings, which help you get to know other people as well as the history and purpose\r\n of APO.</p>\r\n<p>Weekly meetings allow pledges to learn about the history of APO, our mission, and our members. During the course of the term, pledges are required to complete service hours as well as other requirements, detailed in full on our&nbsp;pledge requirements&nbsp;page.</p>\r\n<p>Check us out on Instagram <a href=\"http://instagram.com/apouofm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\r\n@apouofm</a></p>\r\n<p>Check out our website apouofm.com</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Iktinos hopes to expand its membership and create a wide network of professionals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Professionalism </strong></p>\r\n<p>Alpha Rho Chi (APX) prepares its members to live up to the demands and expectations of the business world. Members learn to live and work with other people and to share experiences and ideas, By practicing tolerance, consideration and mutual respect, they observe and develop principals of leadership, service, communication, and human relations.</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Rho Chi provides programs that complement and expand a student's academic training. Programs offered include r&eacute;sum&eacute; and portfolio workshops, tours, and lectures. I.M. Pei, E. Fay Jones, and R. Buckminster Fuller are among the prominent designers that have been featured at APX nationally sponsored events.</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Rho Chi is able to fund numerous scholarships through the Alpha Rho Chi Foundation. The Foundation also sponsors the Alpha Rho Chi Bronze Medal program. This medal is awarded each year to a graduating senior at every accredited college of architecture to encourage professional leadership.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mentoring </strong></p>\r\n<p>A major benefit of Alpha Rho Chi membership is the opportunity for association with the alumni and faculty. Through first-hand information and contemporary experience, these professionals are able to assist in defining academic, personal, and career objectives. Student members have the opportunity to visit design professionals' offices and construction sites and to meet people involved in the building industry. Faculty also serve to council students in career path decisions. Alpha Rho Chi members enjoy strong faculty support because our local chapter helps bridge the gaps, real or imagined, between students, faculty, and practicing professionals.</p>\r\n<p>Student membership in Alpha Rho Chi is instant access to peer support from upperclassmen. With the help of older and wiser members, a student can gain critical insight into the expectations of the upcoming years of study.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Networking </strong></p>\r\n<p>Alpha Rho Chi connects students and professionals to one another across the country and even across the globe. APX members form an extensive professional network of architects, interior designers, landscape architects, and engineers, thus&nbsp;ensuring that there is always a friendly face in any new environment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_column\">\r\n<p>Our alumni associations sponsor casual and formal alumni gatherings on a regular basis.

The single most important aspect of becoming a member of APX is the opportunity to establish both professional and social relationships that will continue long after college. These lines of communication provide opportunities for students and professionals alike to grow in ways unique to Alpha Rho Chi. Activities outside of the classroom or studio encourage the mutual respect and support necessary for a lifetime of opportunity and friendship. The strong ties of brotherhood set Alpha Rho Chi apart from other professional organizations, yet a shared professional interest in architecture and the allied arts differentiates Alpha Rho Chi from other greek letter societies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

Our mission is to empower our members to become well-rounded finance professionals who have a holistic understanding of alternative assets, the financial markets, and investment analysis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our members look forward to a variety of engaging activities throughout the year. During AIC&rsquo;s weekly meetings, members discuss the most recent financial news and trends, learn about different career paths, listen to investment pitches for the club&rsquo;s Investment Fund, and much more. We often meet in the Tozzi Electronic Business and Finance Center to give members access to financial databases like Bloomberg and FactSet, as well as emulate the environment of a real-life trading floor at a hedge fund or investment bank. New members also attend weekly education sessions where they learn about fundamental accounting and finance concepts, investing basics, financial modeling, and more. Throughout the year, we hold case competitions on real estate and private equity to further immerse our members in alternative asset classes, as well as invite guest speakers working in the finance industry to share their working insights and experience breaking into the industry.&nbsp;</p>",

Students must research the product and its competition, identify pain points for its consumers, and devise a comprehensive campaign for the client. Each student team then \"pitches\" its campaign to a panel of judges, and the winning Presentation+Plansbook may become part of the company's next ad campaign.</p>\r\n<p>For more information, please contact Eduarda Galera at eduardar@umich.edu.&nbsp;</p>",

Lung cancer screening lowers the chances of dying from lung cancer by <strong>20-25%</strong>. So, why are only 5.7% of eligible Americans receiving screening every year? The American Lung Cancer Screening Initiative seeks to accelerate the uptake of lung cancer screening by raising awareness among the public as well as government officials. The University of Michigan chapter continues this effort at a local level. There are many opportunities to get involved in ALCSI, from canvassing communities, to contacting local officials, creating content, and more. We our advised directly by University of Michigan physician and are also connected to a network of physicians across the country through their involvement with ALCSI. This club is a great way to make a large impact with relatively low commitment as well as an opportunity for pre-med students to grow their network with physicians across the country.</p>",

        "Description": "<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />ASME International was founded in 1880 as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.&nbsp; Today's ASME is a 120,000-member professional organization focused on technical, educational and research issues of the engineering and technology community.&nbsp;<br /><br />ASME at the University of Michigan is one of the largest and most active Engineering Societies out of more than 70 registered groups. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers at the University of Michigan strives to enhance the professional and social lives of its members as well as other students in the college through a variety of academic, professional, social, community service, and student-faculty events.</p>\r\n<p><strong>General Body Meetings</strong><br />ASME holds bi-weekly general body meetings for its members, during which members hear from a variety of speakers. For some meetings, we invite mechanical engineering professors to speak about their research to show students the broad range of applications of a degree in Mechanical Engineering as well as emerging technologies. We also have professional development seminars to aid our members in their career development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Corporate Luncheons</strong><br />One of ASME&rsquo;s more popular events is its company luncheons. Our group invites both technical and recruiting staff to speak to students. Company representatives speak about the current state of their industry, the functions of engineers in their company, and opportunities for students (be it summer jobs, or permanent hires). These events are open to all engineering students, not just ASME members or mechanical engineering students. These events are designed to allow students the opportunity to learn about potential employers and allow company representatives a chance to reach talented students at the University of Michigan. Lunch is provided to students and speakers. See our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/societies/asme/Corporate.html\">corporate information page</a>&nbsp;for more details and our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/societies/asme/Calendar.html\">calendar</a>&nbsp;for upcoming luncheons.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Social Events</strong><br />In addition to meetings held on campus, ASME strives to&nbsp;provide a social atmosphere to its members outside the academic setting. Our group does this by sponsoring intramural sports teams in which members join together and compete against other societies at the university. In addition to sporting events, ASME hosts a variety of social activities. Some examples include bowling night, ice skating night, and card tournaments. The strong bonds and team-member atmosphere developed in these events extend into the classroom setting. Upper-class members are brought together with lower-class members to help students create a network of contact and friendship within such a large Mechanical Engineering department.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Service Events</strong><br />ASME strives to be a community service group as well. One of our biggest events is the Fun Run, a 5K run for charity. We co-sponsor this event with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/soc/swe/\">Society of Women Engineers (SWE)</a>. The purpose of this event is to raise money for the local charities in Ann Arbor. Corporate sponsors are sought to help make this event possible. In addition to Fun Run, ASME participates in other community service events. We make and host a dinner at the children&rsquo;s hospital twice a year, we participate in a clean-up of local parks twice a year, and we volunteer at soup kitchens in Ann Arbor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Student-Faculty Relations</strong><br />To encourage communication between students and faculty, ASME co-hosts a student-faculty-mixer once a semester. During this event, ASME provides a full buffet of breakfast to students and faculty in the Mechanical Engineering department. ASME officers and engineering professors make pancakes for students and other faculty.</p>",

If you don\u2019t have your own equipment, free&nbsp; recurve rental is available at the range,\r\n as well as several club owned bows are available for use.</span></p>\r\n<p><br style=\"font-weight:400\">\r\n<br style=\"font-weight:400\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight:400\"><strong>How do I join?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Send an email to </span>\r\n<a href=\"mailto:archeryclub-requests@umich.edu\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">archeryclub-requests@umich.edu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> to get more information, meeting times, and to be put on our mailing list!

Some members go out for food and to socialize after practice (this is optional but highly encouraged!) If you want to carpool you can sign up to be a driver or to ride with someone.

Instead of paying dues, you will be paying a smaller fee per\r\n practice you attend. While this pay-by-practice program does not grant you the full Archery Club membership, such as t-shirts and participation in collegiate competitions, it is more economically-suited for those who can only come out to a few practices each\r\n semester.</span></p>\r\n<p><br style=\"font-weight:400\">\r\n<br style=\"font-weight:400\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight:400\"><strong>Do you compete?</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight:400\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">We compete against each other in low pressure internal competitions for fun, and most people keep score during practices to track their progress. Some members also compete in local, state, and national\r\n events and we\u2019re currently working on offering more competitive opportunities for those serious through the club.

Despite this issue's prevalence, Black women's plight in this country is often ignored. Additionally, being free of common risk factors, including economic instability, limited healthcare access, and unsafe housing, cannot prevent these disparities. Implementing social justice interventions and supporting community-based practices that contribute to better health outcomes for birthing people and their children, particularly in communities of color, is critical. This issue is a culmination of racism, misogynoir, and systematic policy and healthcare failures that place Black mothers and babies in vulnerable and life-threatening situations. The ethnocentric biomedical model in our healthcare system, homogeneity, and the impact of systemic racism and implicit bias in the healthcare field will continue to fail marginalized communities if we do not take the necessary steps to address this issue.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This organization aims to use an interdisciplinary approach and implement advocacy measures for Black birthing people through outreach, public health, policy work, doula/midwifery labor support, and community-based interventions. We want to raise awareness on this issue, creating a safe space for meaningful critical discussions and formulating ways to make changes within our communities through doula labor support, partnerships with public health organizations, policy outreach, and more. The maternal health disparity among Black women requires a multifaceted intervention incorporating representations of different academic and industry backgrounds from policy to public health. This organization serves as a community of members of diverse backgrounds passionate about protecting the lives of Black birth givers and children and who believe that becoming a mother should not be a life-or-death sentence.</span></p>",

The Department of Psychology has always entrusted BSPA with the responsibility of reviewing all applications from Black students prior to going to the area admission committees. Through this endeavor, commitment to the support of its members, both socially and academically, as well as an effort to actively recruit and prepare Black undergraduates for graduate study, BSPA became one of the most respected organizations on campus.<br /><br />The BSPA maintains the respect of the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;by continuing to be an active force in recruitment of graduate students of color in psychology. In addition, the organization continues to provide social and academic support for its members, and also strives to be an active force in the community. Most recently, the organization has begun efforts to strengthen its ties with BSPA alumni.

As an affiliate of the University of Michigan and peers of the other BLUElab project teams, we are made up of dedicated problem-solvers working for the betterment of communities around the globe.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">BLUEM focuses first on co-design through cooperation with our community partners in all projects. To do this, we follow the fundamentals of socially-engaged design: an iterative process where community members are at the center of the decision-making, problem identification, and development of solutions. To maximize the effectiveness and impact of our work, we incorporate the environmental, human, social, and economic aspects of sustainability. Using these techniques lead to designs with greater contextual awareness and a greater chance of long-term success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_7\">This year we are working with the University and the City of Ann Arbor on both of their Climate Neutrality goals.

Our team&rsquo;s mission is to use engineering solutions to improve the lives of CasaSito scholars and their families. Over the past few years, our team has prototyped hand-powered washing machines and ventilated wood-burning stoves to save the families time washing clothes and to alleviate health problems caused by inhaling smoke. Members of our team traveled to San Crist&oacute;bal in May 2023 and again in May 2024 to implement these washing machines and stoves in the homes of families in the community. This past May, our team also hosted two hands-on engineering workshops with scholars in San Crist&oacute;bal and Antigua to expose them to the engineering design process as well as to possible careers in engineering. In the 2024-25 year, our team will undertake a rainwater collection project to ensure that families have reliable access to water.&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>",

Here on the campus of the University of Michigan we meet every Thursday for our weekly Bible study, usually at the Michigan League, in which we focus on a part of the Bible that we can apply to our lives as students. We also run Zoom for those who cannot make it to the meeting in person. Please contact Nathan (<a href=\"mailto:lydick@umich.edu\">lydick@umich.edu</a>) for the Zoom link. These meetings are also a great way to meet your fellow U of M students and just vent about the week of classes. During non-pandemic times, we also have monthly parties on Friday which are hosted by a local family. There really is no agenda for these parties other than to show up with a healthy appetite, a desire to enjoy a home-cooked meal, and be ready to meet a lot of people, play some games and have a good time. We also take Mission trips throughout the year, which can vary from year to year on where we go and what we do. If you are curious, please join our meetings on Thursday and check out our website (<a href=\"http://www.christianchallenge.us\">www.christianchallenge.us</a>). We always welcome new people and we look forward to meeting you. Go Blue!</p>",

Second, we plan and run symposia to summarize the events of the conference for our community, bring together experts in the field to answer questions, and highlight opportunities for interested citizens to get involved. We are currently conducting research on opportunities for conferences like COP to reach carbon neutrality.

That's 115 MILLION hectares of space that will be taken away from wild animals' habitat, all so that we can have our giant Shein hauls of cheap clothes that we wear once or twice and send to the landfill within a year. Fast fashion is one of the biggest threats to the planet&rsquo;s biodiversity, but a threat that we do have a fighting chance at stopping.</p>\r\n<p>VIPs (Very Important Primates) is a new club that meets once a week to crochet, knit, bead, sew, embroider, etc., (basically whatever your talent is or whatever talent you wish to learn) so we can create garments that have an eco-friendly life cycle to combat fast fashion. As opposed to cheap fabrics made of plastics that take thousands of years to decompose and rely on abysmal labor standards to produce, we source sustainable materials and since we start from scratch, we get to design all our garments and accessories <br /><br />At VIPs Club, we sell these clothes, stuffed toys, bags, hats, etc. through VIPs Fund, a nonprofit created by university students for this exact purpose. 100% of funds raised through making these sales go directly towards wildlife conservation projects that we develop ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>Membership is open to anyone who is interested in wildlife conservation, fiber art, fashion design, sewing, jewelry, nonprofit work, website building, marketing, advocacy, or any other skill you think would further the mission of Crochet for Conservation and VIPs Fund.

The department offers a variety of course options, from dynamic larger classes that cover a wide exposure to the discipline to interactive smaller classes where students delve deeply into specific topics of interest. Students in our program pursue learning opportunities outside of the classroom, such as volunteer work at community sites (SOC 225), faculty and doctoral student research assistance (SOC 394), study abroad, undergraduate speakers series events, and independent research and writing through our Honors Program in Sociology. We invite you to browse through our website (https://lsa.umich.edu/soc/undergraduates.html) and reach out to us at socadvisor@umich.edu if you have questions about our majors, minors, courses, or department opportunities.

Our vision is to generate conversations within the medical community surrounding not only the problems associated with institutions lacking a diverse system of healthcare providers, but also the innovative solutions that many institutions are actively implementing. While many medical pipeline programs across the country have found success within their local communities, our ultimate goal is to create a coordinated effort to address the lack of diversity in medicine at a national level. We strongly believe that the most effective way to do so is to create a space for students and faculty to come together to present their work, exchange ideas, discover opportunities for collaboration, and reinforce why the work we are doing is so important.&nbsp;</p>",

However, this is not only limited to just underrepresented communities but for people who are passionate and interested in breaking into the fashion industry. We want our members to feel that they aren&rsquo;t just another diversity token, but to feel that they can simply exist within fashion without having to explain their existence whether that be being BIPOC or Queer or both as examples of completing our mission of inclusion. Our organization also aims at social commentary through articles that question the lack of representation of marginalized groups in the fashion market at the University of Michigan. DUEMODA Eboard has the opportunity to attend some of the biggest fashion shows in the globe including NYFW, London Fashion Week, Paris and Milan Fashion Week to name a few.

While their specific skill sets varied, they were collectively passionate about the moving image, and discovered that by working together they could make better films than each could alone. They called their collaboration &ldquo;Filmic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>Soon after its founding, Filmic was presented with the opportunity to start telling stories about Michigan, working with administrators across the University &ndash; in Student Life, Development, Athletics, and Admissions to name just a few &ndash; to chronicle the student experience through film. And thus, Filmic became U-M&rsquo;s first student-led creative production company. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We specialize in creative storytelling and are dedicated to developing unique ideas that stand out among typical commercial videos; from pre- to post-production we take a vision from concept to reality, while engaging diverse perspectives and embracing our motto of </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cinema everywhere. </span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Filmic Productions has had the opportunity to work with notable clients including Lady Gaga&rsquo;s </span><a href=\"https://filmicprods.com/work/channel-kindness\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Born This Way Foundation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://filmicprods.com/work/dance-building\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Michigan Dance Building</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><a href=\"https://filmicprods.com/work/otzi-skincare\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OTZI Skin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a California-based cosmetics company.</span></p>\r\n<p>Filmic&rsquo;s core credo &ndash; &ldquo;Cinema Everywhere&rdquo; &ndash; stems from a collective belief that any story can be made cinematic and impactful, and its members bring that energy to every project they take on.</p>\r\n<p>If you're interested in joining Filmic, our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRETiNcUWv1YyP47LMmvd5oJz-vlCyvA48EhubCTrnj6G8mQ/viewform\"> application</a> is due on September 12th 2023 by 11:59pm!

Galens members take an active role in volunteerism, and interact socially with faculty through activities such as the Smoker, Welcome BBQ, tailgate, and the year-end banquet. The Galens Loan Fund helps defray the cost of residency interviewing at subsidized interest rates. Additionally, students continue to recognize and award teaching and leadership excellence among Medical School basic science and clinical faculty, as well as house officers.</p>\r\n<p>The traditions of community service, extracurricular socialization, faculty cooperation and recognition, and student advocacy have remained central objectives throughout the organization's long history. The success and duration of the organization is attributable not only to the commitment, passion, and charity of its students, but also to that of its alumni and honorary faculty members, who over the years have dutifully served as advisors, mentors, and advocates.</p>",

        "Description": "\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">It all began in early 1997 when a group of University of Michigan Arts Chorale members got together to sing some a cappella music. After much debate and many poetry recitations, the group adopted the name &quot;Gimble\r\n in the Wabe&quot; from Lewis Carroll's poem,&nbsp;Jabberwocky. Since first performing in April of 1998, the group\u2019s name has been refined to Gimble A Cappella, and has evolved into the self-proclaimed quirkiest a cappella group on campus! Each year, Gimblers unite to\r\n host 3 concerts and can frequently be seen performing at various events on campus and around the country during their annual spring tour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Gimble released 7 studio albums on CD before their recent releases on streaming platforms. In 2017, they released a 4-song EP, \u201cXX,\u201d in celebration of their 20th anniversary. Featuring hits like \u201cIf I Go\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m\r\n with You\u201d, it motivated a wave of new releases. Singles \u201cDancing On My Own\u201d and \u201c715 - CR\u2211\u2211KS\u201d debuted in 2018, followed by \u201cFallingwater\u201d and \u201cwhen the party\u2019s over\u201d late in 2019. In 2020, they released their 5-song EP \u201chome,\u201d aptly named both for the home\r\n they shared together and the unmistakable familial atmosphere of the group. Shortly thereafter, Gimble returned with powerhouse covers of Brandi Carlile's &quot;The Joke&quot; and Hozier's &quot;Movement&quot;. Gimble is excited to continue recording their original arrangements\r\n for many years to come!</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Going strong in its 27th year, Gimble A Cappella continues the tradition with a few fresh faces and a continued passion for a cappella music.

We and our partner organizations, Green Umbrella School in Cambodia and Avalon Housing and Washtenaw Literacy in Michigan, aim to maintain long-term partnerships in the name of sustainability to maximize impact. The rights to education, housing, and basic literacy are some of the most important health determinants, and their impacts can have generational effects. GHA aims to support our partner organizations through mutual learning, respect, and understanding. By engaging with self-sufficient local organizations, we gain valuable insights that help us support international partners, like Green Umbrella School, in their journey toward self-sufficiency.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>About Us</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our chapter of the Global Health Alliance is an independent student-run organization and one of the nation's first to partner with three local and international non-profit organizations. Our first partner is Avalon Housing in Ann Arbor, MI. We work with them by helping run the front desk, beautification projects, and art events. Our second partner is Washtenaw Literacy, also in Ann Arbor, MI. With them, we teach English as a Second Language (ESL) to local community members.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our partner outside of the United States is Green Umbrella School in the Putsor Community near Phnom Penh, Cambodia, which believes in the potential of today's youth. Green Umbrella provides quality education to disenfranchised families to achieve sustainable development, facilitates leadership programs to enhance confidence and unity within the community, and leads livelihood workshops for adults and English classes for children. We raise an annual $5,000 for our international partner and assist with their assessment research and education modeling during our 3-week trip every summer. At our Monday night meetings, we plan fundraising and volunteer events and hold discussion-based lessons about public health issues.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why we are a global health club:</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GHA is a global health club because we understand that health does not follow political borders. Global health work is more than collaborating with partners in lower-income countries; it recognizes the local and international connection. Our work abroad informs us of how we solve complex challenges at home and vice versa. We aim to address some of the most significant social determinants of health: education, housing, and literacy rates. Our work involves fundraising efforts combined with co-designing programming with our partners and reflects our commitment to addressing the issues affecting billions of people worldwide. Through our annual efforts with our partners and our weekly club discussions on campus, we aim to understand the complexities of public health issues and take meaningful action to create lasting change&mdash;locally and globally.</span></p>",

The events that GSSA hosts will primarily be educational in nature, while also integrating service and research opportunities for impact in the community. For example, there are many activities we may host including but not limited to suturing events, hackathons, emergency medicine clinics, and panels. Members of GSSA also have the opportunity to foster connections with U of M medical school students and practicing medical professionals in the global health field.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health care is a human right, and GSSA hopes to act as a resource for students to learn about providing care to patients. Though GSSA is a pre-health/med organization, it also highlights the multidisciplinary nature of healthcare. Healthcare is a complex topic that does not simply start with going into the doctor&rsquo;s office. It also involves other disciplines, such as pharmacy, business, public policy, and engineering. We believe that students of differing academic and intellectual backgrounds are vital to the success of our organization.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope to inspire future healthcare providers, encouraging them to think about healthcare and surgery from a broader, more global perspective.&nbsp;</span></p>",

We desire to spur one another on in our mutual journey of faith, to grapple seriously with the intellectual issues of our times from a Christian perspective, and to engage the campus with Jesus Christ. To that end, we have the following objectives:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Spiritual Formation</h3>\r\nGCF is committed to the ongoing development of faithful disciples of Jesus Christ. Through the disciplines of Bible study, prayer, and worship, we seek to become more Christ-like in all areas of our lives. Through small group Bible studies, prayer groups, large group speakers, retreats, and training opportunities, we strive to meet graduate students wherever they are in their spiritual journeys and to challenge them to continued growth and development.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Integration of Faith and Academics</h3>\r\nWe believe that Jesus Christ is the Lord of our whole lives, including both the personal and public areas. As Christian graduate and professional students, Christ calls us to excellence in scholarship and career as well as unwavering obedience to His Word. GCF is committed to affirm the Christian worldview in the university culture by presenting Christian thought in ways that are meaningful to our colleagues and by supporting each other as we explore our call to be servants of Christ in our culture.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Evangelism and Service</h3>\r\nOur primary mission field is the university. We believe that God cares about the university, both the institution and the people who study and work there. Because we feel that the best way to reach other graduate students is through one-on-one relationships, we put emphasis on training and encouraging individuals to reach out to non-Christian friends and colleagues. In addition, we organize regular service opportunities for graduate students to help those in need in our community.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Fellowship</h3>\r\nAs graduate and professional students, we are called to live out Christ's love as a community of believers. We desire to be known as a group that has genuine love for one another. Through our Bible studies and prayer groups, large groups, social events and retreats, we can develop friendships which serve as a base of support and encouragement during challenging times.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_aboutSection\">\r\n<h2>The Fellowship</h2>\r\n<p>Graduate Christian Fellowship is a Chapter of <a title=\"InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA\" href=\"http://www.intervaristy.org/\"> InterVarsity Christian Fellowship</a>, which in turn is part of a world-wide, student-led Christian movement, active in colleges and universities, known as the <a title=\"IFES Website\" href=\"http://www.ifesworld.org/default.asp\">International Fellowship of Evangelical Students</a> (IFES). GCF seeks to minister to graduate students through a variety of student-led programs and activities:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Small Group Bible Studies</h3>\r\n<a title=\"GCF Small Group Bible Studies\" href=\"http://www.umich.edu/%7Egcf/biblestudy.html\">Small groups</a> are the heart of GCF. Meeting weekly for Bible study, prayer, worship, and outreach, these groups (usually 6-10 people) are a key source of support, fellowship, and study.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Large Group Meetings</h3>\r\nThe chapter regularly gathers as a large group for corporate worship and either a speaker or a facilitated discussion.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Prayer Meetings</h3>\r\nGCF coordinates weekly <a title=\"GCF Prayer Meetings\" href=\"http://www.umich.edu/%7Egcf/prayer.html\"> prayer meetings</a>.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Outreach</h3>\r\nGCF sponsors various programs to reach out to the University community. We seek to engage the campus with our faith on an intellectual level, as well as train and encourage others to do the same.</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<h3>Other Activities</h3>\r\nGCF also organizes a variety of special activities, including reading or discussion groups, departmental prayer groups, and various social events, retreats, and conferences.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_aboutSection\">\r\n<h2>Basis of Faith</h2>\r\n<p>As a chapter of <a title=\"InterVarsity Christian Fellowhip/USA\" href=\"http://www.intervarsity.org/\"> InterVarsity Christian Fellowship</a>, Graduate Christian Fellowship is committed to the doctrinal basis of InterVarsity:</p>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_doctrine\">\r\n<p>The only true God, the almighty Creator of all things, existing eternally in three persons - Father, Son, and Holy Spirit - full of love and glory.</p>\r\n<p>The unique divine inspiration, entire trustworthiness and authority of the Bible.</p>\r\n<p>The value and dignity of all people: created in God's image to live in love and holiness, but alienated from God and each other because of our sin and guilt, and justly subject to God's wrath.</p>\r\n<p>Jesus Christ, fully human and fully divine, who lived as a perfect example, who assumed the judgment due sinners by dying in our place, and who was bodily raised from the dead and ascended as Savior and Lord.</p>\r\n<p>Justification by God's grace to all who repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation.</p>\r\n<p>The indwelling presence and transforming power of the Holy Spirit, who gives to all believers a new life and a new calling to obedient service.</p>\r\n<p>The unity of all believers in Jesus Christ, manifest in worshiping and witnessing churches making disciples throughout the world.</p>\r\n<p>The victorious reign and future personal return of Jesus Christ, who will judge all people with justice and mercy, giving over the unrepentant to eternal condemnation but receiving the redeemed into eternal life.</p>\r\n<p>To God be glory forever.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

We offer special seminars, courses, and direct involvement with faculty from the start of students' lives at Michigan. Students are expected to elect half their course work in Honors; many do more. Many Honors students participate in research during their first two years, and almost all Honors seniors pursue their own independent research projects under the guidance of a faculty mentor, leading to an Honors senior thesis.</p>\r\n<p>To help students take the greatest advantage of the rich opportunities at Michigan, Honors advisors meet with them individually, beginning at Orientation and continuing throughout their time here.</p>\r\n<h3>Honors Community</h3>\r\n<p>A vibrant community, no single experience unites all Honors students, yet all are connected through a wide range of activities that enable students to choose what interests them. The Perlman Honors Commons is an intellectual hub, located on the ground floor of Mason Hall (above the Honors offices) where students and faculty come together for study, conversation, and a variety of intellectual and cultural events in truly beautiful surroundings.&nbsp;Organized by the Honor's Resident Advisors (HRAs), you will find students attending musicals, sports events, and visiting coffee hours. Faculty Fellows engage Honors students in a wide variety of ways outside of formal classes. There's something for everyone and all are invited.</p>",
        "Summary": "The Honors RAs work to build an inclusive and vibrant community where students can thrive both academically and socially. This includes planning events and developing opportunities to expand the academic and cultural horizons of Honors students.",

This is a sustainable solution for alleviating a global lack of supplies for those who have vision impairment but don&rsquo;t have access to corrective lenses. The glasses will be shipped to a team of experienced medical professionals who work as part of the Gift of Sight initiative to be distributed to vulnerable communities internationally.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We plan to set up donation boxes in common meeting places and eye clinics on/near campus and monitor them every month. Each month, we collect the glasses, ship them to a nearby processing center partnered with HF that measures them using a lensometer free of charge, and package the frames to be shipped.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Our Mission at The University of Michigan</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are a platform that provides students with the opportunity to work with underserved communities both locally and abroad.

Our lesson plans generate excitement for healthy food, as well as curiosity about what makes\r\n food good for us and why we need to eat healthfully. We plan hands-on activities that allow the children to do the preparation and cooking themselves. This independence and agency empowers the kids to become engaged in and take ownership of what they are putting\r\n into their bodies.

        "Description": "<p>On December 1, 1975, history was made &ndash; history on a college campus, which would transcend other colleges/universities throughout the United States; history which would have a positive impact on the Latino community and our nation; history which would forever change the Greek system, more specifically, the entity known as a fraternity. On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.<br /><br />In 1975, there were no Latino fraternities in existence in the United States. The Greek-letter organizations of the time primarily catered to Anglo and African-American students and graduates. Lambda&rsquo;s founders, as men of vision, realized there was a need to unite the Latino students, develop their leadership skills, impart upon them the value of an education, and instill in them a commitment to their community and culture. The traditional student club would not suffice to accomplish such lofty goals. Hence, Latino unity and brotherhood would be achieved through a long recognized institution &ndash; the fraternity. This newest addition to the Greek system would be the first in the nation, by identity and by name: Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Incorporated.<br /><br />The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the undergraduate level, our brothers are active within the Fraternity and in other student organizations. Our brothers perform community service, promote our culture by sponsoring events which highlight and celebrate our heritage, participate in educational workshops, and enjoy many social programs. As a result of their active participation in every aspect of college life, our undergraduates are developing their organizational, communication, and leadership skills, all while pursuing the coveted diploma. Our younger Lambdas are receiving the training and competence to serve as the future leaders of our brotherhood, community, and nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the professional level, among our ranks you will find attorneys, doctors, and engineers. Our brothers are shaping young minds as educators and as dedicated fathers. The men in brown and white are defending this country at home and abroad in the area of law enforcement and in the armed forces. We are strengthening our country&rsquo;s economy as entrepreneurs. Our brothers are teaching leadership as coaches, mentors, and community activists. The Lambdas are affecting policy and change as elected officials serving on City Councils, Boards of Education, U.S. House of Representatives, and U.S. Senate. In short, Lambdas are contributing and excelling in every facet of human endeavor.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our illustrious history is not only our past but our guiding light to the future. As the first, we overcame many obstacles. Not having much guidance in our formative stages, we persevered and became stronger. Lambda is the product of vision, strength, and unity. Our history serves as a legacy and testament to our accomplishments and greatness.<br /><br />Lambda Theta Phi &hellip; Academic Excellence &ndash; Brotherhood &ndash; Leadership &ndash; Latino Unity -Service.</p>",

Volunteers with LEAP will meet virtually or in person with students in the program and help them with whatever college-admissions related questions or services they may need. We are in connection with local (Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti area) schools and community centers who pass along this information to students who may need it.</p>\r\n<p>Getting involved in LEAP is a great way to earn volunteer hours in a meaningful way! The relationships created with students and the opportunities tutors offer to these students are truly incredible. Tutoring guidelines, resources, and contacts will be provided by LEAP, and at least one hour of tutoring each week (virtual or in person) is required as a member. Schedules for tutoring are arranged with the tutor and their student.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>LEAP is continuously accepting applications.

We put on an annual show which has been showcased at the Michigan Theater and the Mendelssohn Theater, along with various events on campus, including Springfest and the Parent's Weekend Tailgate. But our performances aren't just limited to on campus events- L&eacute;im Irish dancers enjoy performing&nbsp;at events like&nbsp;Midnight Madness in downtown Ann Arbor, and collaborating with local schools and assisted living facilities.

In the United States, fall trauma in hospitalized environments is a large issue that current infrastructure only passively addresses. Relevant current solutions include remote presence devices, bedside alert systems, and strength reliant assistive devices such as walkers and canes. While these product do a good job of mobilizing hospital infrastructure in response to a fall incident, they depend on caregivers and do not mitigate the damage already done.</p>\r\n<p>Although we are focused primarily on hospitalized, high-risk patients, although options with more autonomous elderly individuals / rehabilitation devices are also being explored. Alongside advising physicians in both U of M Geriatrics and U of M Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, our team emphasizes working closely with patients and caregivers to solidify the needs of these key users to help drive and engage our own design process. We hope to provide students opportunities to participate in all parts of the design process from needs assessment to prototyping, as well as chances to work side by side with healthcare partners and patients. Our goal is to ultimately design a device that not only makes life safer for older adult patients, but also to make caregivers&rsquo; jobs easier.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>The Neonatal Asphyxia Project, referred to by its members as NAP, was founded in 2016 by a group of students with a passion for applying their Michigan educations to combat high infant mortality rates in underserved regions. They chose to focus on hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), more commonly referred to as neonatal asphyxia; a condition that is one of the leading causes of death for newborns. Research identified hypothermia therapy as the only medical intervention shown to improve infant brain function, and so they set a goal: to design a device that would safely and effectively apply the therapy to mitigate the complications associated with the condition. Since then, NAP has grown into a multidisciplinary team of students who continue to work to achieve this goal. We are currently designing and building different device prototypes.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>Under anesthesia required for surgical procedures, a patient experiences vasodilation and loses the ability to properly regulate their body temperature, causing a core-to-peripheral redistribution of body heat. If core body temperature drops below 36.0 \u2103, it becomes perioperative hypothermia, which may lead to cardiac events, impaired pharmacodynamics, increased risk of infection, excess blood loss, and even organ failure. In turn, this creates worsened patient outcomes, prolonged hospitalization time, and increased medical expenses. Perioperative hypothermia has been reported to affect about 70% of surgical patients, thus establishing a need for an active warming system to prevent it from occurring. Through a needs assessment conducted in the Dominican Republic in Spring 2022, our team found that many healthcare systems across the country lack effective methods for maintaining patient core body temperature during surgeries. Current solutions used in the United States are expensive, non-reusable, and require manual controls, making it difficult to implement them in the Dominican Republic. Thus, based on our needs assessment and additional feedback from advisors, our team is currently developing a reusable, low-cost heated mattress element with an automatic control system to adjust mattress temperature in response to feedback from non-invasive core body temperature readings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is a need for a method of regulating patient core body temperature during surgery to prevent perioperative hypothermia and the ensuing complications that arise in low-resource hospitals. Thus, our team&rsquo;s mission is to provide a safe, effective, affordable, and reusable solution to allow healthcare systems across the Dominican Republic to effortlessly maintain patient core body temperature during surgery, resulting in improved patient outcomes and a reduced financial burden for both hospitals and patients. Specifically, our team strives to give operating rooms the ability to monitor core body temperature and maintain normothermia in patients during surgical procedures to prevent complications and discomfort that may arise as a result of perioperative hypothermia.</p>",

The Solar Fridge is an inexpensive, low-maintenance vaccine storage refrigerator for long-term, on-site vaccine storage that ensures the safety and viability of vaccines in low-resource communities. Between 2008 and 2012, this project transitioned between different departments and teams. Although the general focus of vaccine sustainability has persisted, the user needs and target population were either lost or not found. Therefore, the project has recently focused efforts on the reevaluation of its needs assessment approach. During the summer of 2017, our team performed a problem definition trip with our community partners in Rincon Claro--a small village in the Dominican Republic. We learned that the greatest problem they are facing is on-site vaccine storage, making the Solar Fridge a perfect fit. We also visited other communities and validated this as an overarching problem in this region. This trip has helped Solar Fridge in re-establishing a need, allowing for future progress towards improving vaccine sustainability.

        "Description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hybrid infant warmer design seeks to seamlessly combine kangaroo care (KC, also called skin-to-skin contact) and an external heating method into one device. There are three components which also provide the structure for the three subteams within The Initiative: bassinet, heating pad, and KC carrier. The bassinet houses the heating pad and is the standalone component of the device. The heating pad is the external heating method, and uses a resistive wire to generate heat and a control system to monitor heat output and maintain the system temperature at 37 degrees Celsius. The KC carrier is the wearable component that supports skin-to-skin contact. This component has been mostly developed, and is moving into a more marketing/business focused phase. These three components combine together into a cohesive device that aims to provide continuous warmth from two different heat sources. Through our hybrid infant warmer, we hope to globally eliminate mortality in low birth weight infants and provide families the opportunity to grow and thrive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LEARN MORE ON OUR WEBSITE:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mheal.engin.umich.edu/theinitiative\">http://mheal.engin.umich.edu/theinitiative</a></span></p>",

They are intellectual inquiry, community service, and self-governance.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Intellectual inquiry</strong></span> is the first pillar of Telluride House. While all three pillars are appreciated equally, House members have consistently prided themselves on being the leaders and best in academics at the University of Michigan. This spirit appears in house life as well, where the intellectual inquiry manifests itself in the form of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pubspeaks (student presentations on any topic you are knowledgable on and wish)</li>\r\n<li>Faculty Forums (similar to PubSpeaks, but for&nbsp;resident&nbsp;faculty)</li>\r\n<li>Documentary screenings</li>\r\n<li>Guest speakers and lecture series</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Community service</strong></span> is our second pillar. Through House projects, members of the Telluride House come together to make a difference in their community while also furthering the goals of the house and the association. Projects change from year to year, but have in the past included high school tutoring with Peace Neighborhood Center, working with political refugees in Detroit, or meal preparation at Food Gatherers.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Self-governance</span></strong> is our third pillar at Telluride House. Our autonomy and practice of self-governance is a unique aspect of the house in comparison to other organizations at the University of Michigan. At Telluride House, self-governance means&hellip;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>House meetings, following Robert's Rules of Order, where students make administrative and budgetary decisions about the house processes</li>\r\n<li>Committee work (Entertainment Committee, Logistics Committee, Advisory Committee, and Recruitment Committee.</li>\r\n<li>Democratic development and selection of our community service project</li>\r\n<li>Democratic selection of new house members and faculty guests, through application review for two, yearly cycles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Whether sitting in House meetings, working in a committee, or amending the by-laws, there are countless opportunities for and experiences with leadership and self-governance inherent in house life.</p>\r\n<p>Other benefits of the fellowship include (but are not limited to): Miscellaneous funds allocated for house improvements, events and outings, snacks and beverage preferences, streaming service and magazine subscriptions; exposure and mentorship from other members across diverse fields (Medicine, Law, Social Work, Engineering, Philosophy, History, etc.); freshly cooked meals from a personal chef, each day; fully furnished rooms; lifetime membership to the Telluride Association; opportunities for grants and funding associated with community service, thesis writing; a home gym, free parking/parking passes, and more.</p>\r\n</div>",

MI DNA Day provides a unique opportunity for high school students to meet and interact with young scientists, which often clarifies misconceptions of what a scientist looks like and breaks down barriers for students to follow scientific career paths. Scientist ambassadors also discuss their own ongoing research with students and share exciting career opportunities in science and biotechnology. Moreover, MI DNA Day allows early-career scientists to share their passion for science with students, fostering a spirit of public engagement leading to continued participation in science outreach throughout their careers.</p>\r\n<p>MI DNA Day takes its name from National DNA Day, which was created to commemorate the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 and the discovery of DNA&rsquo;s double helix in 1953.

The purpose of MES is to enhance our members' academic experience through a variety of events. We put particular emphasis on career and exclusive recruiting events, bringing prominent alumni back to campus as well as providing academic support through tutoring and mentors for core Economics classes. Ultimately, we hope to create closer bonds between students interested in economics and provide a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment to further the knowledge and education of engaged members of the organization.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>Interested in Economics but not an Economics major?

The two main objectives of MEMSC is to educate the general public by hosting events and teaching courses on campus, and to spark interest in medicine as a whole. MEMSC currently has over 100 active members, 40+ of whom are licensed EMTs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MEMSC takes pride in providing quality education for our members and the greater U of M community. We believe that education is one of the most important aspects in developing responder skills, and one of the best ways to connect with our community on a more personal level. The Michigan EMS Club offers a range of educational classes such as Stop the Bleed, CPR/AED/BLS certification (through the AHA), and first aid courses to not only club members, but the greater Michigan community.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our club maintains a close relationship with Huron Valley Ambulance, a local private EMS agency, to facilitate the training, certification, and service of emergency medical technicians at Huron Valley Ambulance. Through HVA, we have certified approximately 15 EMTs through a dedicated course for U of M students. In addition, many EMS Club members have graduated from HVA's EMT program. We have also recently partnered with HVA to assist in a volunteer program in which non-certified members can assist EMTs at local U of M events and ride along in an ambulance to spark further interest in becoming a first responder.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the academic year, the club hosts monthly mass meetings where members get together to announce updates, collaborate on projects, and learn various prehospital skills. In these meetings, members can learn about research and further career opportunities. Many members now work on the M-RISE project, which aims to improve neurological outcomes following cardiac arrest, and the Toyota Drone Study, which seeks ways to improve the accessibility of EMS supplies in the field via the use of a drone. MEMSC also aims to increase career interest in meetings by bringing in a variety of guest speakers. Over the past 2 years, MEMSC has been pleased to host guest speakers with many agencies and individuals including: Ann Arbor Fire Department, HVA Dispatch, HVA Public Relations, HVA MICU paramedics, the Washtenaw/Livingston Medical Control Authority, Washtenaw County Hazmat, and multiple medical students completing residency in emergency medicine. Guest Speakers give presentations, offer advice, and bring in interactive medical equipment to spark greater interest in emergency medicine/EMS. Through the various opportunities we provide at MEMSC, we hope to build and foster interest in the prehospital field of medicine.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

We also host occasional events like murder mysteries and tournaments. We strive to be a welcoming, casual, and safe community for all University of Michigan students to play games.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>When and where do you meet?</em></p>\r\n<p>We meet for game nights every Tuesday and Friday on the third floor of Mason Hall starting at 6pm and going until whenever. We usually get 30+ people at game nights, and have gotten more than 100 at mass meetings. We also have occasional events during game nights or on weekends.</p>\r\n<p>Sign up for the email list to get a weekly email with specific room numbers, events notifications, and links to join GroupMe and Discord:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/vWCxxGR2C2Pz4Wc79\">https://forms.gle/vWCxxGR2C2Pz4Wc79</a></p>\r\n<p><br /><em>How do I join the club?</em></p>\r\n<p>Show up to a meeting! There&rsquo;s no formal membership or attendance policy, and all UofM students are welcome. You&rsquo;re also free to invite non-students.</p>\r\n<p>We use GroupMe (primary) and Discord (secondary) as club discussion and meme pages and for announcements. You&rsquo;ll get a link to those from any of our emails when you've joined the email list. (and also room locations, event details, etc.)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/vWCxxGR2C2Pz4Wc79\">https://forms.gle/vWCxxGR2C2Pz4Wc79</a> (a link so good we wrote it twice)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Who owns the games?</em></p>\r\n<p>You do! The club owns very few games games; everyone brings games and forms groups. Just show up, grab a game and a group, and play! And if you don't know what to do, ask anyone who's there. We're a very welcoming club; so long as you're up to try something new, you'll be able to fit in.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>So what kinds of games do you play?</em></p>\r\n<p>All Kinds! Here&rsquo;s a few:</p>\r\n<p><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Social Deduction</span> - Secret Hitler, Blood on the Clocktower, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, The Resistance/Avalon, Werewords<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Bluffing</span> - Skull, Coup, B.S., Sheriff of Nottingham, Masquerade<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Misc.

You will likely find success if you try to get a group together in our main chat before game night. For a consistent Magic playgroup, checkout Magic: The Gathering Club.</p>\r\n<p>We also do not play any casual video-gaming like Jackbox, MarioKart or Super Smash Bros, although again these aren&rsquo;t off the table, they&rsquo;re just not our focus. You&rsquo;re more likely to find playgroups for these sorts of games games at the Casual Gaming Club.</p>\r\n<p>We also also don&rsquo;t play D&amp;D, Pathfinder, or role-playing campaign games. If that is something you are into, we recommend you check out the Tabletop Gaming Club!</p>\r\n<p>There are also dedicated clubs for chess and euchre, although we play both occasionally.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>What&rsquo;s your commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion?</em></p>\r\n<p>We have a dedicated DEI Committee whose goal is to help ensure all members and attendees feel safe and welcome at the club, and that will monitor an anonymous form for attendees to bring up any issues or concerns. In general the club is committed to keeping our community free of discrimination, harrassment, and bullying of any kind, in any form.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>It&rsquo;s free right?</em></p>\r\n<p>Mostly Yes! Showing up to weekly game nights and playing games is entirely free. We do ask that you pay a semester dues fee for certain events, usually anything where members bring food or use gas to drive somewhere, but also for participating in the biweekly tournaments. Dues are only $1-5 per semester, your choice. We also often accept bringing food or snacks for members as paying dues.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>What types of events?</em></p>\r\n<p>Most common is our once every three weekly tournaments, where we have small, optional, tournaments during regular game nights of different games with the winner earning pride and bragging rights. Other events we do during game nights include pot lucks, movie nights, de-stress days (coloring sheets &amp; nail painting), and holiday events like gift exchanges or costume contests. We also do stuff outside normal game nights like murder mystery nights put together by our members, or trips to places like cider mills or ice-skating rinks.</p>\r\n<p>The events committee is also very open, so you should speak up if you have any ideas or want to help run something!</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>Where do I ask other questions?</em></p>\r\n<p>You should send an email to <a href=\"mailto:gamesboard@umich.edu\">gamesboard@umich.edu</a> if you have specific questions. It&rsquo;ll reach everyone on the executive board.</p>\r\n<p>You could also read our constitution; it's linked below. It details the club's purpose and commitments and also the executive board structure and election procedure.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>Founded in 1998, Michigan Interactive Investments (MII) is a highly selective, leading undergraduate investment club at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. Each year, MII builds an investment portfolio with the goal of educating members about investing through interactive portfolio management. By maintaining a small, dedicated member base of approximately 60 undergraduate students, MII is able to effectively teach members about investing in a variety of equity, fixed income, and derivative securities. MII is unique in that we manage a $25,000 student-run portfolio. We have complete freedom over our investment strategies and asset classes, which include long/short equity, fixed income, and currencies.</p>\r\n<p>MII utilizes a multifaceted investment strategy involving both fundamental and quantitative analysis to invest in equities, options, and fixed income instruments. We take a disciplined approach to investing, focused on a medium-term outlook for attractive returns while preserving capital. Furthermore, we primarily use a bottom-up approach to source investment ideas, while also implementing top-down and quantitative screening strategies to identify opportunities that will outperform our S&amp;P 500 index benchmark. Additionally, we supplement this fundamental approach to investment selection with technical analysis to identify appropriate entry and exit points for our positions.</p>\r\n<p>MII also provides many resources to help members secure internship and full-time job placements, and hosts the Undergraduate Investment Conference (UIC) each fall. The UIC invites participants from over 20 of the top universities in the country for a featured stock pitch competition. The winner is awarded an approximately $3,000 grand prize, and the Conference includes a keynote speaker and the opportunity for students and corporate partners to meet and network.</p>\r\n<p>We pride ourselves on MII&rsquo;s three core pillars: Education, Investing, and Professional Development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Education</strong></p>\r\n<p>An important goal of MII is to educate members about investing and strengthen their knowledge of financial markets. This goal is comprised of three parts: First, new members have the opportunity to attend &ldquo;Breakfast Club&rdquo; sessions to learn the basics of investing, including how to source investments, value firms, and use financial data tools. Second, senior members make presentations during club meetings on more advanced topics, such as distressed debt investing, options valuation, and monetary policy. Third, every meeting features a market update that provides members with a better understanding of current economic conditions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Investing</strong></p>\r\n<p>MII builds a student run portfolio through a process in which members evaluate market sectors and pitch their best investment ideas. After the pitch, members vote on whether the security should be added to MII&rsquo;s portfolio. Profits are reinvested into the club, either towards growing the size of the portfolio or funding special events throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Professional Development</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our members are high performing. Graduating seniors have gone off into a variety of firms on both the sell side and buy side. The following list omits many firms, but on the sell side, members have gone on to work for Deutsche Bank, Evercore, Guggenheim Partners, Goldman Sachs, M. Klein &amp; Copmany, Moelis &amp; Company, Morgan Stanley, PJT Partners, The Raine Group, Royal Bank of Canada, and Rothschild Global Financial Advisory. On the buy side, members have worked for Ares, Apollo, Bridgewater, Insight Venture Partners, KKR, and Prudential Capital. As such, members can expect an extensive network that can open many doors during recruiting season.</p>",

MJAS accepts submissions&nbsp;from around the globe in the social sciences and humanities concerning Asian studies. Where opportunities exist, other journals confine their dialogues so narrowly as to include only one region, which consequently limits discussions that transcend regional&nbsp;boundaries. MJAS supports a broader scope of Asian culture, which consequently allows&nbsp;MJAS to accept more submissions and publish more frequently. Furthermore, it is the&nbsp;intention of MJAS to deepen appreciation and encourage interest into the rich and diverse&nbsp;cultures found in greater Asia, which is facilitated by affording students the venues in&nbsp;which to participate in the discussion.</p>\r\n<p>Besides appealing to those students who wish to publish, MJAS is useful for&nbsp;students at large in the field because MJAS archives its publications online, free to the&nbsp;public. With respect to MJAS&rsquo;s component on campus, MJAS wishes to manifest its&nbsp;presence through hosting various meetings: recruitment for both editors and would-be&nbsp;authors; mini-presentations from students preparing research projects; and appearances&nbsp;by professors to lecture or discuss their current research in the field of Asian studies.</p>",

The Journal strives to create a dialogue about serious issues in international affairs, one which is not based on rhetoric or bellicose grandstanding. Greater goals include the formulation of ideas that future leaders can draw on to lead to superior foreign policy.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to publication, the Journal hosts social and academic events addressing current topics in world affairs, often with special guests that work in relevant career fields.</p>\r\n<p>For students interested in applying to write for the journal, please visit <strong> mjia.org/apply&nbsp;</strong>to get more information and access our application!</p>",

        "Description": "<p>Where: Michigan Union; Room switches each week. Please see email that goes out every week for room.&nbsp;<br /><br />When: 6-8pm every Wednesday<br /><br />What: We teach students how to knit and/or crochet. All projects made with club supplies are donated to those in need. During weekly meetings, students knit, crochet, and converse for two hours. Meetings are not mandatory. The club provides all knitting/crocheting supplies (yarn, needles, crochet hooks, etc). To take a project home, a deposit of $5 for yarn and $5 for the needles/crochet hook ($10 total) is required. The money is returned after the completion of the project. This way, students who want to learn to knit/crochet can without needing to invest money in supplies. We accept students of all skill levels, from I-have-never-picked-up-yarn-before beginners to I-am-on-my-fifteenth-sweater experts. Although most projects are for charity donations, the club also welcomes folks who want to work on their own personal projects in a group setting. <br /><br />Why: Create goods to warm the local community and learn/expand crafty skills<br /><br />If you would like to set up a time to sign out materials, or if you want to donate items you have knit or crocheted (or items like food products or toiletries) to homeless shelters without joining Mknit, or for any other questions/comments/concerns, please feel free to contact Jillian Dore at jdore@umich.edu</p>",

We develop and execute our own research projects in the area of synthetic biology. Students have the opportunity to gain hands on experience in conducting scientific research, running a laboratory, engineering novel biological systems, fundraising, public outreach, leadership, and working as part of a multidisciplinary team. Every year, the team competes in the International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) jamboree competition in Paris, France.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>What is Synthetic Biology?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthetic Biology combines biology and engineering to design, construct, and test biological devices and systems. Combining these two disciplines allows us to better understand life, and use that understanding to benefit society. Synthetic Biology is distinct from Genetic Engineering in that the latter only alters existing genes, whereas the former utilizes existing, modified, and man-made genes to make life perform useful functions not normally found in nature. Through synthetic biology, it may be possible to solve some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging problems such as energy shortage, environmental pollution, and disease. However, we must be wary of potential safety and ethical issues along the way.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>What is iGEM?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iGEM is an international undergraduate synthetic biology competition. In 2015, iGEM consisted of 259 teams and 2700 participants from all over the world. Every year, teams research, design, construct, and test a novel biological system. Students have at their disposal bits of DNA from the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological parts to help aid them in building their biological &ldquo;machine&rdquo;. In addition, students are encouraged to build their own parts and develop new techniques to make life easier to engineer. Teams also help to increase awareness for synthetic biology through public outreach and analyze safety concerns as a part of the project design process. Projects are wide ranging and are divided into the following categories: Environment, Food and Nutrition, Energy, Foundational Advance, Health and Medicine, Information Processing, Manufacturing, Software Tools, and New Applications. For more information, see</span><a href=\"http://igem.org/Main_Page\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">igem.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Who Can Join?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any undergraduate student with an interest in synthetic biology and biological engineering is welcome to join! No previous experience is required. We also welcome members with extensive lab experience, especially with expertise in specific techniques, including human cell culture, Gibson assembly, and plasmid engineering. In addition, we always have places for students interested in mathematical modeling, business, programming, web design, and animation. Our team is composed of undergraduate students from a variety of majors, including (but not limited to) Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mathematics, Biophysics, Neuroscience, Microbiology, Philosophy, and Materials Science &amp; Engineering. We also have graduate students and faculty advisors from multiple colleges and departments on campus. Students will become acquainted with the theory and techniques during weekly meetings from February to the end of Winter Semester, at which point we will transition to working on the year&rsquo;s project, continuing into the Spring, Summer, and following Fall Semester, until our competition in late October. To join, applications start in the middle of January!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: Per iGEM rules, students over the age of 23 by March 31 may not perform work. They can however be advisors to the team. Students in a 5-year combined bachelor's/master's degree program who are not older than 23 are eligible to join!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Moli brings to our audience an eclectic collection of dances and performances that evolve from China's thousands years of history: from ethnic dances, to classical dances, and eventually to modern chinese fusion dances. Through Moli, we bring to the University of Michigan community a unique set of eastern movements, thinking, and arts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Growth:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Moli's literal meaning is the jasmine flower, which is a symbol of friendship in Chinese culture. We welcome both experienced and inexperienced dancers to join the dance troupe. In the long run, Moli aims to expand the realm of performance to Chinese Drama and Chinese costume modeling. We firmly believe that while Moli brings to our audience the best pieces of performing arts from Chinese culture, the strong interests in Eastern arts and dancing in the University of Michigan community will continue support us and help Moli grow.&nbsp;</p>",

In addition to daily practices, cross country meets, and track meets, we also have numerous social events and charity events throughout each semester! We have&nbsp;about 200 dues-paying members so there's always someone to run with! In the past we've traveled everywhere from Hershey, Pennsylvania, to Richmond, Virginia, for meets.</p>\r\n<p><br />Getting involved with MRun couldn't be easier--all you have to do is start showing up! During the fall we compete in Cross Country meets, and in the Winter/Spring, Track and Field. Beginning the first day of school in September we hold daily practices that offer a variety of running routes and distances. We meet outside the Central Campus Recreation Building (CCRB) on the walking bridge over Washtenaw Ave.&nbsp;every weekday at 4:15 PM where we will have usually a 3 mile, 5 mile, and 7 mile group go out for runs! We go to races about every other weekend during the Fall, and travel to locations anywhere from East Lansing, Michigan to Anderson, Indiana to Hershey, Pennsylvania. We also have a very successful Track and Field program so if you are not interested in long distance running, there are great opportunities for sprinting, jumping and throwing throughout the entire school year. There are track facilities available and practices and workouts for these events as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />However, the absolute best thing about MRun is that every practice, event, or anything is completely optional. You can come as much as you want! We have people who show up every day, and others once a month--it's entirely up to you!</p>\r\n<p><br />As for social events and charity events, nobody does them better than MRun. During the beginning of the year, we have a bunch of events to help new members (especially Freshmen) get to know everyone in the club. We often joke that we're really just a giant \"MRun family\" and we've been told that we're one of the most welcoming clubs on campus. Keep in contact with the club&nbsp;as the school year gets closer so&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;know more specifically when these events are! There will be a mass meeting, social events, and many other fun things&nbsp;going on first semester to make the transition into the club as easy and fun as possible!</p>",

Familiar music helps them become more present and connected to their environment, so the program focuses on each individual by providing live performances and personalized playlists on digital devices. The club relies on volunteers to inquire about residents&rsquo; musical preferences and perform songs they would enjoy. All levels of expertise in instrument/vocals are welcome. MFD is a venue for volunteers to meet, form musical groups, and perform in front of an audience. UofM students mainly volunteer at the Brookdale and Orchard Hills care facilities in Ann Arbor, but we hope to expand to other facilities as well! Other sites are also available for those residing outside of Ann Arbor. Volunteer orientation is offered at the beginning of the semester and online workshops are provided throughout.</p>",

Our students can talk about their classes and the things they are involved with, share some of their experiences, and give families first-hand perspective about what it is like to be a student here. Besides providing campus tours and answering questions as panelists, they also assist with registration and helping our guests have a positive experience.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To learn more about Campus Day, come chat with us at Festifall or Northfest, or check out the video below!

One of our main initiatives is funding the construction of 1,000 schools in Honduras. This is the number of schools that will allow every child in Honduras to have access to a quality education. Since its founding, OTS has&nbsp;completed 67 schools.</p>\r\n<p>Honduras is the home of major cities like San Pedro Sula, where the murder rate and gang populations are high enough to consistently make them front page news on the New York Times and other prestigious US news sources. In 2009, Shin Fujiyama received a CNN Heroes award for his work in Honduras and appeared on shows like Larry King Live to explain the groundbreaking work One Thousand Schools was facilitating in Honduras.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>OTS is only able to build schools in Honduras through the fundraising and volunteering provided by high school and collegiate chapters in the United States.&nbsp;100% of&nbsp;funds&nbsp;donated by a chapter&nbsp;goes&nbsp;directly&nbsp;towards&nbsp;funding the construction of schools&nbsp;in Honduras. Members of those chapters have the opportunity to travel to Honduras and help build the schools they worked hard to raise money for. This is both an&nbsp;incredible&nbsp;learning experience for people and a great motivator for students to continue their fundraising efforts. OTS has a perfect safety record, and each member comes back with a changed perspective and enriched knowledge of life very different from theirs, as well as true hope for what can be accomplished through continued hard work in Honduras building schools and in the United States building chapters.</p>\r\n<p>The University of Michigan chapter of One Thousand Schools looks to build a community of passionate, strong-willed University of Michigan students who can help (1) build knowledge and awareness of the University of Michigan campus of the current issues being faced by Honduras and, as a consequence, how those issues translate to current border disputes and international politics, (2) raise money to build schools and donate school supplies to the communities working with SHH in Honduras, and (3) send volunteers on a safe and empowering service trip to Honduras at least once per year to participate in the building of these schools and to learn about the culture and people of Honduras.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This organization hopes to build a movement of young UM leaders with the collective goal of empowering and providing fundamental human needs to impoverished children and families in Honduras by promoting awareness through volunteerism and global responsibility.</p>",

We have three different programs within our organization: Pre-K, K-12, and Adult.&nbsp;<br /><br />What we do:<br /><br />Our Pre-Kindergarten program focuses on younger children and helping them prep for school. Our Pre-K program uses lots of resources from the AADL such as games, children's books, and online learning games.&nbsp;<br /><br />Second is our K-12 program. In this program we focus on helping the kids with the schoolwork that they bring with them to our tutoring sessions. The amount of work they have varies by student, therefore tutors are also ready to work with their students on the subjects they may have a more difficult time with... extra practice is always good!&nbsp;<br /><br />Finally, we also have an adult ESL program. This program focuses on helping parents and other community members with their English. For this program, we like to have tutors who are proficient in Spanish.&nbsp;<br /><br />With all three of our programs, we pair one or two students with a tutor. We welcome anyone who wishes to be a tutor or a student with us. We especially love getting new tutors as we have a long list of students awaiting a placement.

Any member can submit a workshop or presentation, and then, they can teach the club a new skill using a workshop or introduce new ideas through a presentation. This aspect of our club can be used by our members to improve their presentation skills, increase their knowledge of a particular subject, or practice a presentation for an important event.

Participating in these events individually can be challenging since they can demand hours or days of your time or even require registration fees. We provide the resources to make this process easier. We set up a system allowing you to create competition teams open to the club and request funding for registration fees, making it easier to participate in these events and gain the credentials associated with them.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Community</strong></span><br />\r\n<div>Besides the activities we list above, we also want to provide a space for those interested in scientific computing to meet one another, share experiences, and possibly collaborate.</div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Leadership Structure</strong></span><br />\r\n<div>Finally, This club has a robust leadership structure that allows many members to participate in leading the club to the degree that is suitable to them. The leadership is organized into six committees: an Executive Committee and five task-based committees. The Executive Committee can have at least 9 positions, and the task-based committees are composed of four members. Graduate student members may be elected to positions on the Executive Committee, and any club member may be nominated to a position on the task-based committees by the respective committee chair.</div>\r\n</div>",

As well as creating diversity on campus and in the workplace and providing opportunities for members to give back to their communities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">In addition to the national mission, the SASE-UM chapter has a mission to establish an active presence of Asians in engineering and science on campus and engage in the community by emphasizing each individual's technical skills. Furthermore, we hope to strengthen the leadership and communication skills of our members to better prepare them in the business world and their careers.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"width: 665px;\">Founding</h3>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">The University of Michigan chapter of SASE was founded in October 2010, and has since gained support from various departments in the university. Before a SASE chapter was started at the University of Michigan, there were many other ethnic scientific and engineering societies, but none that that truly represented those of Asian heritage. It was on this basis that the University of Michigan chapter of SASE was founded as well as the entire nationwide SASE community. The national SASE community was founded in 2007 by 10 Proctor and Gamble interns. Today, the SASE community spans across many colleges nationwide.</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Facebook:&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/sase.umich</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Instagram:&nbsp;https://www.instagram.com/sase.michigan/</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Slack:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">um-student-sase.slack.com</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Website:&nbsp;http://www.umich.edu/~sase/</p>",

SRP was founded in 2013 in response to the tremendous need for free, high-quality representation and support for students facing suspension and expulsion hearings in southeast Michigan. In all of our activities, SRP seeks to keep students in school, learning, and out of the criminal justice system. Members of our organization become talented interviewers and oral advocates. They also develop zeal and cultural humility.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to advocating for students in disciplinary hearings, SRP advocates also:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>support community outreach and youth development work;</li>\r\n<li>lobby for youth&shy;-centered and restorative school discipline policies and laws;</li>\r\n<li>provide targeted special education support for students facing disciplinary exclusion due to disability &shy;related behaviors;</li>\r\n<li>engage in non-&shy;hearing advocacy in disciplinary matters;</li>\r\n<li>host and attend events designed to educate the university and larger community about the school&shy;-to-&shy;prison pipeline in Michigan and best practices to oppose it; and</li>\r\n<li>challenge institutional threats to educational opportunities for children.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A centerpiece of SRP is its interdisciplinary advocacy, combining the strengths of education, social work, public policy, and law in order to promote positive outcomes for Michigan&rsquo;s youth. Our advocates are valued for their contributions to student advocacy, whether that be training in client interviewing, statutory research, or helping families access community resources. For this reason, each hearing advocacy is comprised of students from each discipline, insofar as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Since our founding, SRP has partnered with the Student Advocacy Center of Michigan (SAC) in the shared drive to end the school&shy;-to&shy;-prison pipeline in the state. SAC is a non&shy;profit educational advocacy organization headquartered in Ypsilanti, Michigan. SRP receives its referrals through SAC&rsquo;s intake process, and our case advocacy is supervised by an SAC attorney. Each organization supports the other in their collective youth justice efforts.</p>",

The idea for this student organization was created after members of the Race and Curriculum Committee of MJRL recognized that they'd like to do more advocacy within the law school but are restricted due to the limited number of Committee members (4). STARS is aware that many affinity groups address racial problems on campus through advocacy and events, but think it would be advantageous to form a student organization that is not an affinity group dedicated to this topic. This group would appreciate and welcome intersectionality and diverse viewpoints, as other identities that we hold impact racial issues at the law school.&nbsp;</p>",

We have been working with both communities to improve in-home water access and water storage infrastructure. Our projects use recycled, discarded, and regionally accessible materials.

At the time, about 90% of rental units in Ann Arbor were not up to code. Similar to today, the quality of rental housing was low and the prices high. The rent strike, which lasted two years, involved tenants paying their rent into an offshore escrow account rather than to the landlord. Landlords would receive their rent from the account if they either brought the rental unit up to code or agreed to collective bargaining with the tenants union. Collective bargaining in this context would entail a negotiation between the landlord and a Tenants Union representative over the provisions in the leasing contracts for all tenants renting from that particular landlord. This differs from the normal process of the landlord negotiating individually with each tenant. The strategy was successful in </span><a href=\"https://aadl.org/node/201294\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some instances</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but many landlords ultimately did not agree to collective bargaining. Nonetheless, the AATU was able to significantly improve the quality of rental units in Ann Arbor and challenge the power of landlords both at rental complexes and in the city and state government.&nbsp;</span></p>",

Beyond that, when it is crossed with computer programming, electrical engineering, biomedical engineering, or animal studies, it gains an even broader scope of possibilities. We hope to expose students to the many facets of this broad, advancing field.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 36pt; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">If you are interested in joining the mailing list so that you can stay up-to-date with events, please email Caroline (cgebczak@umich.edu)&nbsp;or Tanay (tanbhan@umich.edu).</span></p>",

While many of the products that students will be creating will be engineering-based, TOM:UM encourages and even seeks out other students who are not engineers (artists, physical therapists, etc.) to be members of the teams that create solutions for these individuals. With the new challenges faced due to COVID-19, TOM will be hosting both in-person and virtual events including hosting speakers and working and&nbsp;design challenges to address problems for those in need.

However Triangle, in every sense, breaks the mold of what a fraternity is and ought to be. The original founders chose to not have Greek letters because they did not want an organization that&nbsp;<em>loosely</em>&nbsp;focused on&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;thing. Rather,&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;fraternity was established as a means to create a close-knit community of like-minded men that focused their efforts on&nbsp;<em>several</em>&nbsp;core aspects of life and strived to achieve the perfect balance between work, play, and service to the community.</p>\r\n<p>So what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Triangle Fraternity? At the University of Michigan, Triangle is a community of various students studying technical programs, such as engineering, biology, neuroscience, and architecture, centered around its chapter home and its core values. The members strive for the balanced lifestyle and forge lifelong friendships along the way. At the national level, Triangle Fraternity is an organization that seeks to develop men as leaders and create a widespread network of individuals dedicated to personal growth, brotherhood, and their professional interests.</p>\r\n<p>Each member joins Triangle for a different reason, but&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;member is able to find an atmosphere which fosters friendship and academic, social, and professional growth.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>Under the strategic partnership between the University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), the UM-SJTU Joint Institute (JI, https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn) was founded to cultivate a new generation of leaders who are able to corporate and innovate in a global context. The collaboration between the two universities started with engineering majors in 2006 and has now expanded to business, science, etc. Every year more than 150 SJTU students come to UM through the dual degree (2+2), GDP (3+2), or joint graduate (4+1) programs. As the official student organization recognized by both universities, UM-SJTU Joint Institute Alumni Association (JIA) is completely run by graduated and current SJTU students and is aimed at serving the SJTU students and alumni at UM. We work with both universities as well as industry partners to provide professional development resources, culture immersion programs, and networking opportunities. We help the students and alumni be involved and successful at UM. In addition, JIA also serves as a community builder by connecting cross-culture and cross-industry talents together. We work closely with the alumni association from both universities. President and advisors of JIA also serve on the board of directors of the SJTU Alumni Association in Greater Michigan (SJTUAAMI).</p>",

        "Description": "<p><strong>Interested in joining the team for 2024-2025? Fill out our interest form for information about our mass meeting and to sign up for coffee chats (free coffee!) with team officers:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/MMrAUHdfYhWRmkTL7\">https://forms.gle/MMrAUHdfYhWRmkTL7</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>We are an engineering team that designs, fabricates, and programs a robotic surface vessel that can navigate obstacles and perform tasks on the open water all on its own with no human interaction. Working year-round, the team competes internationally against other autonomous boats every March in RoboNation's RoboBoat Competition in Sarasota, Florida. Last season, we took home 6th out of 28 teams, and won two awards - but this year, we're chasing the top.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our team is multidisciplinary, and has no barrier to entry - we encourage students from all different schools and colleges within the university with only a persistent curiosity and good spirits required. The goal of the team is to create a functional, efficient vessel while seeking out opportunities for learning and growth every step of the way.&nbsp;Bringing up questions and proposing adjustments are encouraged, as they help make a more cohesive team and a better overall product.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The team is split up into five main subteams: Mechanical, Electrical, AI, Advanced Capabilities, and Business.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The mechanical team designs and fabricates a new boat for competition each year, employing naval architecture and marine engineering principles to create resilient, waterproof hulls that can cut smoothly through the water, and a deck and superstructure that can support and protect the electronics housed within the boat. In addition, they provide support for mounting sensors onboard and help facilitate the boat's testing in the water in the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory. Students majoring in ME, NAME, ISME, RE, and many others can find their interests here!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our electrical team is responsible for all electronics onboard - they ensure that the boat has a reliable, safe electrical system capable of supporting the immense amount of software running on deck, which is crucial to our overall performance. Every year, they build a full computer capable of supporting our AI team's work, designing printed circuit boards (PCBs), and protecting everything in secure housing. Students majoring in Computer and Electrical Engineering, as well as those interested in integrated systems in general, are encouraged to join!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The AI team develops all of the boat's software, and consists of the bulk of our team - without them, our boat would simply be a sitting duck. Their team consists of multiple parts - Computer Vision, Task Planning, and Navigation/Controls. All of these make up a software pipeline that work in tandem to perceive tasks and obstacles, plan paths around or toward them, and navigate the boat according to that path. Computer Science and Robotics Engineering students, as well as anyone interested in programming, is encouraged to join!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Advanced Capabilities team is an interdisciplinary unit that works closely with other subteams to develop task-specific hardware and software that can vary wildly with the changes in competition challenges every year. Members work on specific mechanisms, and are responsible for everything from CAD, electronics, and embedded software, while ensuring integration with other subteams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the Business team is what holds our team together - not only do they coordinate the finances and budget for the team, working to secure private sponsorships and manage funding, but they also market the team to the rest of the university and the world. Through outreach events, interaction with other teams and even some of our competition, to managing our technical documentation and presentation material for both our judges and the sponsors we work with, they ensure a unified brand and a team that can continue to reach new heights. While STEM students are highly encouraged, the business team also offers endless opportunities for those from any other discipline - everything from art, to writing, to business, to management is crucial to our team's success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our team welcomes all, and encourages opportunities to learn, grow, and build the most important ship of all - friendship!&nbsp;If you have an interest in helping create an unmanned vessel, come join the team!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>More information can be found at <a title=\"UM::Autonomy\" href=\"https://www.umautonomy.com\"> www.umautonomy.com</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"UM::Autonomy 2023 Team Video\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxFV9WLaQ88\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxFV9WLaQ88</a></p>",

As an organization, we hold multiple events throughout the semester that promote discussion, evoke empowerment, and provide an alternative social setting for students. In our writing, our artistic expression, and our events,&nbsp;<em>What the F&nbsp;</em>is dedicated to a form of feminism that values intersectionality and inclusively. We recognize that individuals face oppression through multiple different facets of their identity, whether it be through gender, race, nationality, sexual identity, religion, ability, etc. We aim to support, to heal, and to express ourselves freely. Reach out to whatthefmagazine@gmail.com if you would like to get involved in our community!</p>",
        "Summary": "What the F strives to educate the student population at the University of Michigan on topics related to feminism and identity, and to empower and participate in feminist action by publishing two magazines during the year and hosting many events.",

We provide our members with the knowledge and tools necessary to safely enjoy the sport. Anyone is welcome, whatever your skill/experience level. Other water sport enthusiasts (canoe, SUP, etc.) are welcome to join too, but our instruction experience and gear are primarily focused on whitewater kayaking.</p>\r\n<p>While whitewater kayaking is our primary focus, we also offer other nature-related activities (like camping road trips and kayak sledding) depending on member interest/availability and weather.</p>\r\n<p>WWKC is a voluntary organization administered by the University of Michigan. Non-student members are welcome; however, the club must maintain at least 50% student membership to be a UM club sport. Because of university policy, we are not allowed to have non-student participants under the age of 18.</p>\r\n<p>We are working to update our information on Maize Pages. Please disregard the Meeting information within the constitutions; we do not currently meet at NCRB pool. We will send out information on weekly kayaking sessions, weekend trips and winter pool sessions at the start of the next semester. We usually don't offer any sessions or trips during the summer, but if you're hoping to kayak and looking for a group to join, <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/emu-paddlers\">Michigan Adventure Paddlers</a> is a great option (and we can also send you other resources if you'd like)</p>\r\n<p>If you'd like to participate in club activities please join through Maize Pages and/or reach out to Jon (jdlowry@umich.edu) and Liem (liem@umich.edu). They're also happy to answer any questions if you're curious about the club or whitewater kayaking. You can also reach out to Avik (abmondal@umich.edu) and Christina (chendren@umich.edu), but they are very busy with pursuing PhDs.</p>\r\n<p>The most up-to-date social media below that we still use is our Instagram page @wwkayakmichigan.</p>\r\n<p>If you're passionate about kayaking and would be interested in helping the club (with instruction, student outreach, etc.), send us an email!&nbsp;</p>",

Founded in 1994 by three students: Danny Schwab, Scott Doyne, and Jeff Holzhausen, WOLV TV has evolved from simply covering Michigan Ice Hockey games to producing ten different shows and even partnering with the Big Ten Network to live-broadcast a range of Michigan sports!<br /><br />Where do our new members fit in? Everywhere! Each show successfully functions because of its crew. Crew members start at WOLV by being taught to operate a camera, run the TelePrompTer, mix the audio, run the switcher, edit highlights or packages, write scripts, conduct live interviews, or whatever job the show needs to run smoothly. We highly encourage new crew members to try many of these positions. Then, if a crew member decides to apply for a producer role and is selected, he or she will be responsible for passing on their knowledge to their new crew members.</p>\r\n<p>If you're interested in finding out more information, check out our website http://wolvtv.org or email join.wolv@umich.edu.</p>",

Young Americans for Freedom is a\r\n project of Young America's Foundation, which is a national non-profit organization which was founded in 1960 to develop and promote conservative ideas among our nation's young people. While the YAF chapter at the University of Michigan was originally founded\r\n decades ago, the chapter was reorganized in 2015 after being dormant for several years. Since then, the chapter has hosted the likes of Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, and other speakers, in addition to weekly meetings, tabling, and social events.\r\n Our chapter also won YAF Chapter of the Year in 2019.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>What We Do</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas on campus through weekly meetings, speaking events, tabling, and social events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Meetings</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter meetings are held on Tuesdays at 7 p.m. in Room D of the Michigan League. We typically discuss current issues and important conservative ideas as a group. Board members often give presentations on specific topics of interest to spur a deeper\r\n dive into the issues. Members and non-members are free to join us at our meetings to discuss the issues and meet fellow conservatives.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Speakers</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas through speaking events each year. Our speaking events (typically one each semester) are designed to give U of M students the opportunity to hear from some of the most prominent and cutting edge conservative voices,\r\n as well as ask questions during the Q&amp;A portion of the event. Our events are always free and usually live streamed on YAF's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yafumich.com/youtube.com/YAFTV\">Youtube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Tabling</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas on campus by tabling in support of various topics several times each semester. We typically set up a table on the Diag or in Mason Hall to discuss conservative ideas with students. We also take part in YAF's 9/11 Never\r\n Forget Memorial each September, where we place 2,977 flags on the Diag to honor those who lost their lives on September 11th.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Social Events</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter also hosts social events to have fun together as a chapter. We typically hang out several times each semester to play paintball, walk around the Arb, go ice skating at Yost, or enjoy a bonfire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conferences</strong></p>\r\n<p>Members from our chapter typically attend several YAF conferences throughout the year. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yafumich.com/yaf.org/events\">yaf.org/events&nbsp;</a>for more information</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text-content\">\r\n<h3><strong>The Sharon Statement</strong></h3>\r\n<p>In this time of moral and political crises, it is the responsibility of the youth of America to affirm certain eternal truths.</p>\r\n<p>We, as young conservatives, believe:</p>\r\n<p>That foremost among the transcendent values is the individual\u2019s use of his God-given free will, whence derives his right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force;</p>\r\n<p>That liberty is indivisible, and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom;</p>\r\n<p>That the purpose of government is to protect those freedoms through the preservation of internal order, the provision of national defense, and the administration of justice;</p>\r\n<p>That when government ventures beyond these rightful functions, it accumulates power, which tends to diminish order and liberty;</p>\r\n<p>That the Constitution of the United States is the best arrangement yet devised for empowering government to fulfill its proper role, while restraining it from the concentration and abuse of power;</p>\r\n<p>That the genius of the Constitution\u2014the division of powers\u2014is summed up in the clause that reserves primacy to the several states, or to the people, in those spheres not specifically delegated to the Federal government;</p>\r\n<p>That the market economy, allocating resources by the free play of supply and demand, is the single economic system compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government, and that it is at the same time the most productive supplier\r\n of human needs;</p>\r\n<p>That when government interferes with the work of the market economy, it tends to reduce the moral and physical strength of the nation; that when it takes from one man to bestow on another, it diminishes the incentive of the first, the integrity of the second,\r\n and the moral autonomy of both;</p>\r\n<p>That we will be free only so long as the national sovereignty of the United States is secure; that history shows periods of freedom are rare, and can exist only when free citizens concertedly defend their rights against all enemies;</p>\r\n<p>That the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these liberties;</p>\r\n<p>That the United States should stress victory over, rather than coexistence with, this menace; and</p>\r\n<p>That American foreign policy must be judged by this criterion: does it serve the just interests of the United States.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n",
