We are part of a national network of outstanding students, faculty, and professionals that sponsor events at many major universities. We also provide other opportunities for our members to flourish professionally and personally, and our members span worldwide and are united at basic convictions discussing the United State's role in the world. Our activities include:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Hamiltonian Statecraft</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Every student who applies to be an author will have an opportunity to get published on an issue in international relations and national security on a semesterly basis. Under the guidance of our Editor in Chief, members would receive close mentorship and active feedback on five possible entry formats: research paper, academic essay, Op-Ed, policy proposal, and book review. Additionally, students would have the opportunity to crosslist the publication with the national organization&rsquo;s journal, The Hamiltonian.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Hamiltonian Diplomacy</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Selected AHS members will compete in bisemesterly conferences per year for any of the following: Model UN, Model NATO, Model European Union, and Model Arab League. The delegation team would be led by the Director of Academic Programs, who would assist and coach delegates in successfully representing our Chapter to the national conference.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Speaker events and panels</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The speaker panels/events provide students an understanding of what American leadership has achieved. They address complex global issues from multiple perspectives with a goal to promote critical thinking. Speakers include former Secretaries of State, Secretaries of Defense, Directors of CIA, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Senior Fellows at esteemed think tanks and civil societies in Washington D.C.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>National Programming:</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The national charter runs intensive programs for students to educate skills and knowledge for foreign affairs and national security careers. Members of the AHS would have the opportunity to engage with scholars in foreign policy and national security through expert panels, chapter training, professional development, and networking opportunities. These include the National Defense Fellowship run by the AHS and the Ronald Reagan Institute, the Hamilton National Fellowship that provides grants for summer internships in Washington, DC, and book series that provide a wide perspective to foreign affairs, defense, and economic policy.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Wargaming and policy simulations</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The wargames and policy simulations, designed by RAND Corporation, would serve to educate our membership on American grand strategy, defense policy, and budgeting forward engagement. Led by the Director of Policy, wargames and policy simulations would be run on a monthly basis on various formats and various international crisis scenarios to provide a firsthand experience in managing and executing U.S. foreign and defense policy abroad.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, AHS stands for basic principles in U.S. foreign policy that include:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A conviction, rooted in the history of the last century, that the world is a better, safer, and more prosperous place when the United States is willing and able to lead. And a commitment to maintaining the moral authority and material strength on which that leadership rests.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An appreciation that the world remains a dangerous place in which our power must be exercised with prudence, and where the primary threats to our security come from states that deny freedom to their own people and from non-state actors who embrace hatred and violence.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clear recognition that, in such a world, our true friends and reliable partners are other democratic nations with whom we share an enduring commonality of values, and not simply a temporary convergence of interests.</span></li>\r\n</ul>",

With an active focus in social, philanthropic, and sisterhood activities, the young women of Alpha Chi strive to make an impact in our community and the Michigan campus as a whole.</p>\r\n<p>Each one of our young women is unique. With members from the east to the west coast, and even overseas, our various backgrounds help to enrich the experiences of every Alpha Chi. From an academic standpoint, diversity continues to shape our house with members pursuing degrees in Literature, Science, and the Arts, Engineering, Art and Design, Nursing, Business, and much more. Members of the Theta Chapter not only uphold their academic integrity, but they also strive to uphold the other principles of an Alpha Chi as well such as personal development and their leadership abilities. Our young women are active in over 80 organizations on campus ranging from A Cappella groups to club sports and many hold prominent leadership positions throughout campus.</p>\r\n<p>Although each member is different and we are a diverse chapter, the presence of Alpha Chi Omega and the sisterhood that it offers shape our college experiences in a similar way. Activities such as painting &ldquo;the rock,&rdquo; all chapter lunches,&nbsp;as well as picnics in the Arb, and philanthropy events help bring together the different pledge classes of the Theta Chapter.</p>\r\n<p>Giving back to the Ann Arbor community is one of the most rewarding aspects of being an Alpha Chi at Michigan. Because the Women&rsquo;s Center of Southeastern Michigan is located right here in Ann Arbor, we are lucky enough to have members volunteer their time weekly to help women and children in need. It is in this way that our members are fortunate enough to personally see their hard philanthropic work be put to use. We take pride in philanthropic endeavors throughout the year and encourage our members to pursue community service regularly. We regularly participate in other sororities&rsquo; and fraternities&rsquo; philanthropies as well as in the University-wide Greek Week to support various philanthropic organizations in the area.</p>\r\n<p>The Theta Chapter of Alpha Chi Omega truly is &ldquo;The Michigan Difference.&rdquo; &nbsp;To all of the alumnae, please feel free to contact me at axoumichpresident@gmail.com for any information about our chapter! We would love to hear your success stories and about how the bonds that we will create today extend beyond these four years at Michigan.</p>\r\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\r\n<p>Chapter President</p>",

On Friday, April 10, 2009, the Epsilon Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc. reached its 100th year in existence. This milestone was not only an accomplishment for the chapter, but for the entire University of Michigan community, the city of Ann Arbor, and the Michigan District and Midwestern Region of Alpha of Alpha.<br /><br />Ever clinging to the motto &ldquo;Nothing Questionable is Accepted,&rdquo; we at Epsilon chapter<br />continue the tradition of excelling scholastically, athletically, and socially. A testament to this truth, Epsilon Chapter boasts 10+ Phi Beta Kappa Members, 10+ Athletic All-Americans as recently as 2000, and a steady stream of honors, awards, and accolades for service. We strive through comradeship to attain the noble goal of a balance between social and academic life and have proven wrong those who declare that both of these phase of existence are incompatible and mutually inhibitory.<br /><br />We understand and recognize that past is prologue to the future and that an intimate familiarity with and reverence for what has gone on before is both central and essential to our ongoing development and survival. Brotherhood, scholarship, leadership, and service, the four principles upon which the Jewels founded Alpha Phi Alpha, continue to be the guiding values of Epsilon. It can be said that fraternity life in Alpha Phi Alpha has shown us that the ideals to which we aspire are worth striving for and that Epsilon chapter continues to be a &lsquo;rendezvous for fraters, a sanctuary for scholars, and a haven for gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>",

We acheive this goal by providing a wide variety of projects. Some of our most popular projects are the UM vs. OSU Blood Battle, Knitwits, Crafts for Motts, and Passing Notes.</p>\r\n<p>The rush process for Alpha Phi Omega is held at the beginning of the fall and winter semesters, and at these times the chapter will hold mass meetings to help inform students about the organization. While this phase of joining the organization is called \"rush\", it is not very similar to the rush you would participate in for Greek houses -- it is extremely easy and non-competitive.</p>\r\n<p>During the week of our mass meeting, we hold a series of rush events, which are open to anyone interested in joining APO (these often include&nbsp;service projects, happy hours, and&nbsp;fellowship&nbsp;events). These give you a chance to get to know members of APO and see if it's something you'd like to be a part of. There is no \"bid\" selection - anyone who wants to be a member of APO can join.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anyone interested in APO may attend a Pledge Initiation Ceremony to become an APO Pledge Member. The Pledge Initiation Ceremony will be at the beginning of each semester, after rush has ended.</p>\r\n<p>Your first semester in APO will be full of opportunities to learn about the organization and find your place in it. That is the essence of the pledge process. You will undergo an initiation ritual, and be assigned to a \"big\" - an older APO member who will answer any questions you have and help you figure out the ins and outs of APO. You will attend all the same meetings as the Active Brothers do, and you will also attend pledge meetings, which help you get to know other people as well as the history and purpose of APO.</p>\r\n<p>Weekly meetings allow pledges to learn about the history of APO, our mission, and our members. During the course of the term, pledges are required to complete service hours as well as other requirements, detailed in full on our&nbsp;pledge requirements&nbsp;page.</p>\r\n<p>Check us out on Instagram <a href=\"http://instagram.com/apouofm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> @apouofm</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Iktinos hopes to expand its membership and create a wide network of professionals.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Professionalism </strong></p>\r\n<p>Alpha Rho Chi (APX) prepares its members to live up to the demands and expectations of the business world. Members learn to live and work with other people and to share experiences and ideas, By practicing tolerance, consideration and mutual respect, they observe and develop principals of leadership, service, communication, and human relations.</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Rho Chi provides programs that complement and expand a student's academic training. Programs offered include r&eacute;sum&eacute; and portfolio workshops, tours, and lectures. I.M. Pei, E. Fay Jones, and R. Buckminster Fuller are among the prominent designers that have been featured at APX nationally sponsored events.</p>\r\n<p>Alpha Rho Chi is able to fund numerous scholarships through the Alpha Rho Chi Foundation. The Foundation also sponsors the Alpha Rho Chi Bronze Medal program. This medal is awarded each year to a graduating senior at every accredited college of architecture to encourage professional leadership.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mentoring </strong></p>\r\n<p>A major benefit of Alpha Rho Chi membership is the opportunity for association with the alumni and faculty. Through first-hand information and contemporary experience, these professionals are able to assist in defining academic, personal, and career objectives. Student members have the opportunity to visit design professionals' offices and construction sites and to meet people involved in the building industry. Faculty also serve to council students in career path decisions. Alpha Rho Chi members enjoy strong faculty support because our local chapter helps bridge the gaps, real or imagined, between students, faculty, and practicing professionals.</p>\r\n<p>Student membership in Alpha Rho Chi is instant access to peer support from upperclassmen. With the help of older and wiser members, a student can gain critical insight into the expectations of the upcoming years of study.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Networking </strong></p>\r\n<p>Alpha Rho Chi connects students and professionals to one another across the country and even across the globe. APX members form an extensive professional network of architects, interior designers, landscape architects, and engineers, thus&nbsp;ensuring that there is always a friendly face in any new environment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_layoutArea\">\r\n<div class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_column\">\r\n<p>Our alumni associations sponsor casual and formal alumni gatherings on a regular basis.

The single most important aspect of becoming a member of APX is the opportunity to establish both professional and social relationships that will continue long after college. These lines of communication provide opportunities for students and professionals alike to grow in ways unique to Alpha Rho Chi. Activities outside of the classroom or studio encourage the mutual respect and support necessary for a lifetime of opportunity and friendship. The strong ties of brotherhood set Alpha Rho Chi apart from other professional organizations, yet a shared professional interest in architecture and the allied arts differentiates Alpha Rho Chi from other greek letter societies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

We often meet in the Tozzi Electronic Business and Finance Center to give members access to financial databases like Bloomberg and FactSet, as well as emulate the environment of a real-life trading floor at a hedge fund or investment bank. New members also attend weekly education sessions where they learn about fundamental accounting and finance concepts, investing basics, financial modeling, and more.

        "Description": "<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States, but what many people don't know is that <strong>lung cancer can be cured</strong> when identified early enough. Lung cancer screening lowers the chances of dying from lung cancer by <strong>20-25%</strong>. So, why are only 5.7% of eligible Americans receiving screening every year? The American Lung Cancer Screening Initiative seeks to accelerate the uptake of lung cancer screening by raising awareness among the public as well as government officials. The University of Michigan chapter continues this effort at a local level. There are many opportunities to get involved in ALCSI, from canvassing communities, to contacting local officials, creating content, and more. We our advised directly by University of Michigan physician and are also connected to a network of physicians across the country through their involvement with ALCSI. This club is a great way to make a large impact with relatively low commitment as well as an opportunity for pre-med students to grow their network with physicians across the country.</p>",

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers at the University of Michigan strives to enhance the professional and social lives of its members as well as other students in the college through a variety of academic, professional, social, community service, and student-faculty events.</p>\r\n<p><strong>General Body Meetings</strong><br />ASME holds bi-weekly general body meetings for its members, during which members hear from a variety of speakers. For some meetings, we invite mechanical engineering professors to speak about their research to show students the broad range of applications of a degree in Mechanical Engineering as well as emerging technologies. We also have professional development seminars to aid our members in their career development.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Corporate Luncheons</strong><br />One of ASME&rsquo;s more popular events is its company luncheons. Our group invites both technical and recruiting staff to speak to students. Company representatives speak about the current state of their industry, the functions of engineers in their company, and opportunities for students (be it summer jobs, or permanent hires). These events are open to all engineering students, not just ASME members or mechanical engineering students. These events are designed to allow students the opportunity to learn about potential employers and allow company representatives a chance to reach talented students at the University of Michigan. Lunch is provided to students and speakers. See our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/societies/asme/Corporate.html\">corporate information page</a>&nbsp;for more details and our&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/societies/asme/Calendar.html\">calendar</a>&nbsp;for upcoming luncheons.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Social Events</strong><br />In addition to meetings held on campus, ASME strives to&nbsp;provide a social atmosphere to its members outside the academic setting. Our group does this by sponsoring intramural sports teams in which members join together and compete against other societies at the university. In addition to sporting events, ASME hosts a variety of social activities. Some examples include bowling night, ice skating night, and card tournaments. The strong bonds and team-member atmosphere developed in these events extend into the classroom setting. Upper-class members are brought together with lower-class members to help students create a network of contact and friendship within such a large Mechanical Engineering department.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Service Events</strong><br />ASME strives to be a community service group as well. One of our biggest events is the Fun Run, a 5K run for charity. We co-sponsor this event with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.engin.umich.edu/soc/swe/\">Society of Women Engineers (SWE)</a>. The purpose of this event is to raise money for the local charities in Ann Arbor. Corporate sponsors are sought to help make this event possible. In addition to Fun Run, ASME participates in other community service events. We make and host a dinner at the children&rsquo;s hospital twice a year, we participate in a clean-up of local parks twice a year, and we volunteer at soup kitchens in Ann Arbor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Student-Faculty Relations</strong><br />To encourage communication between students and faculty, ASME co-hosts a student-faculty-mixer once a semester. During this event, ASME provides a full buffet of breakfast to students and faculty in the Mechanical Engineering department. ASME officers and engineering professors make pancakes for students and other faculty.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>Apex Trading Group was founded in October, 2014 with the goal of fostering advancement in financial literacy on a University-wide scale. Our organization began as a group of like-minded individuals seeking the opportunity to create a portfolio management club with an emphasis not only on managing money as a team, but providing members with educational sessions as well. These sessions begin for new members with topics so basic as &ldquo;What is a Stock?&rdquo; and advance on a club-wide basis through &ldquo;Investment Strategies&rdquo; and &ldquo;Financial Modeling.&rdquo; Now, we are beginning to integrate a powerful professional development concentration to our organization, which will include Ross essay assistance for those applying, r&eacute;sum&eacute; workshops, cover letter workshops, networking practice, mock interviews, and more. Everything we do focuses on one idea: educating our members and providing them with the opportunities for leadership positions in an effort to build financial leaders. If you desire a club environment focused on portfolio management, knowledge and information, professional maturation, and building lifelong connections with the students around you, Apex is the student organization for you.</p>",

Despite this issue's prevalence, Black women's plight in this country is often ignored. Additionally, being free of common risk factors, including economic instability, limited healthcare access, and unsafe housing, cannot prevent these disparities. Implementing social justice interventions and supporting community-based practices that contribute to better health outcomes for birthing people and their children, particularly in communities of color, is critical. This issue is a culmination of racism, misogynoir, and systematic policy and healthcare failures that place Black mothers and babies in vulnerable and life-threatening situations. The ethnocentric biomedical model in our healthcare system, homogeneity, and the impact of systemic racism and implicit bias in the healthcare field will continue to fail marginalized communities if we do not take the necessary steps to address this issue.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This organization aims to use an interdisciplinary approach and implement advocacy measures for Black birthing people through outreach, public health, policy work, doula/midwifery labor support, and community-based interventions. We want to raise awareness on this issue, creating a safe space for meaningful critical discussions and formulating ways to make changes within our communities through doula labor support, partnerships with public health organizations, policy outreach, and more. The maternal health disparity among Black women requires a multifaceted intervention incorporating representations of different academic and industry backgrounds from policy to public health.

The&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;chapter was formed in 1969 to deal mainly with the recruitment and support of Black graduate students and faculty.<br /><br />At its height, membership rose to more than 60 students, and the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;became a leader in the training of Black Ph.D.'s in Psychology.<br /><br />During the early 1970's, the Department received more than 100 Black applications annually. The Department of Psychology has always entrusted BSPA with the responsibility of reviewing all applications from Black students prior to going to the area admission committees. Through this endeavor, commitment to the support of its members, both socially and academically, as well as an effort to actively recruit and prepare Black undergraduates for graduate study, BSPA became one of the most respected organizations on campus.<br /><br />The BSPA maintains the respect of the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Michigan&nbsp;by continuing to be an active force in recruitment of graduate students of color in psychology. In addition, the organization continues to provide social and academic support for its members, and also strives to be an active force in the community. Most recently, the organization has begun efforts to strengthen its ties with BSPA alumni. In so doing, the organization aims to both create a viable resource for support and professional socialization and acknowledge the accomplishments of a rich legacy. A large portion of BSPA's strength lies in its history. May the legacy continue.</p>",

The third show will be the show in residency -- and that show will have about three- four weeks to workshop and work with their team and then they will have a fully realized stage production at the end of the semester.</p>\r\n<p>The point of Blank Space Workshop is not to produce finished work or full productions.

        "Description": "<p>This past semester, we began two new projects involving CasaSito scholarship-recipients and their families. The first is focused on prototyping more efficient stoves that reduce smoke output and require less firewood. Our goal is to decrease the portion of family income going towards buying wood, as well as decreasing the risk for smoke-related illnesses. The second project is focused on developing sustainable washing machines to be used within communities. These will be portable, make the washing process more efficient, and serve as a potential source of income. Over this summer we traveled to Guatemala to build our prototypes, where we had a successful trip and will continue to refine the prototypes moving forward.</p>",

Here on the campus of the University of Michigan we meet every Thursday at a local church for our weekly Bible study in which we focus on a part of the Bible that we can apply to our lives as students. We also run Zoom for those who cannot make it to the meeting in person. Please contact Nathan (<a href=\"mailto:lydick@umich.edu\">lydick@umich.edu</a>) for the Zoom link or if you need a ride to the church. These meetings are also a great way to meet your fellow U of M students and just vent about the week of classes. During non-pandemic times, we also have monthly parties on Friday which are hosted by a local family. There really is no agenda for these parties other than to show up with a healthy appetite, a desire to enjoy a home-cooked meal, and be ready to meet a lot of people, play some games and have a good time.

That's 115 MILLION hectares of space that will be taken away from wild animals' habitat, all so that we can have our giant Shein hauls of cheap clothes that we wear once or twice and send to the landfill within a year. Fast fashion is one of the biggest threats to the planet&rsquo;s biodiversity, but a threat that we do have a fighting chance at stopping.</p>\r\n<p>VIPs (Very Important Primates) is a new club that meets once a week to crochet, knit, bead, sew, embroider, etc., (basically whatever your talent is or whatever talent you wish to learn) so we can create garments that have an eco-friendly life cycle to combat fast fashion. As opposed to cheap fabrics made of plastics that take thousands of years to decompose and rely on abysmal labor standards to produce, we source sustainable materials and since we start from scratch, we get to design all our garments and accessories <br /><br />At VIP&rsquo;s Club, we sell these clothes, stuffed toys, bags, hats, etc. through VIPs Fund, a nonprofit created by university students for this exact purpose. 100% of funds raised through making these sales go directly towards wildlife conservation projects that we develop ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>Membership is open to anyone who is interested in wildlife conservation, fiber art, fashion design, sewing, jewelry, nonprofit work, website building, marketing, advocacy, or any other skill you think would further the mission of Crochet for Conservation and VIPs Fund.

He graduated with honors from the Hamster High School for gifted hamsters, and was admitted to the prestigious University of Hamster, Go Ham! A double major in Business and Hamster Studies, president of the Hamster's Glee Club, celebrated member of the Business Honor Society, Eta Alpha Mu (HAM), and all still with time to cut loose on the weekends, Harry had it going on, with more coming.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Yet in all his handsome achievements, one thought kept nagging at Harry. \"If I have so much going for me, why do I feel so empty?\" Harry would ask himself while standing on the ham-bus, looking around at all the other hamsters. Luckily, with his busy schedule, coupled with all the parties&nbsp;and events that an institution like the University of Hamster has to offer, Harry found he could easily push such unsettling thoughts out of his mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Then one night, lying awake after having received an A- on a short research paper, Harry spoke bitterly into the silence, \"What's the point of it all, anyway? All this running around, chasing grades and awards, making money just to spend it. Work, party, repeat. Sometimes my life just feels like a big hamster wheel. (Contrary to popular stereotypes, studies show that educated hamsters have a strong aversion to hamster wheels.) Always running and never going anywhere. Will it really be different once I'm employed? I mean, look at Howard. Sure, he gets the occasional nice vacation, but he's always complaining about his job. And Hannah says she got her dream job, but she still parties like work sucks. At the end of the day, what am I even doing here?\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Harry continued to toss and turn all night. He thought about everything he ever wanted in life. He&nbsp;knew those things could make him happy, but he began to wonder&nbsp;how long they could <em>keep</em> him happy. \"Why doesn't anyone ever talk about these things, Oscar?\" Harry asked his stuffed orca. \"Am I really the only hamster on this campus who wants to find the answers to&nbsp;this stuff? Surely there must be others!\" And so began Harry's quest to find other hamsters who were willing to come alongside him in his search for answers. To this day, it is said that Harry continues on his quest, holding fast to his conviction that no hamster should be made to stand alone before the looming mysteries of the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Dead Pizza Society is a community of students dedicated to creating a safe space to contemplate the mysteries of life, share experiences and perspectives, and enjoy some free pizza. It is here that students of every background are encouraged to come together and&nbsp;step out of their&nbsp;weekly rhythms to enjoy the beauty of life and question how we might more fully enjoy all that it has to offer. Whether you're looking for a good time, deeply conflicted, or just interested in free pizza, feel free to stop by most Tuesday nights at 7:00pm (Michigan time; it will never die in our hearts). Find details on location under events, or join our roster to get emailed updates. We usually meet until around 9:30pm, but you are welcome to come as late&nbsp;and leave as early&nbsp;as you desire.</p>",

Dressember is a nonprofit organization and advocacy campaign for which advocates wear a dress or tie every day of December to raise awareness of human trafficking while fundraising to help end it. The dress or tie serves as the conversation starter to educate your community about human trafficking.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>\r\n<p>Human trafficking is a widespread human rights issue that disproportionately impacts women, girls, people of color, and LGBTQ+ people. According to the United Nations and the International Labour Organization, more than 40 million people are currently victims of human trafficking, about 1 in 4 victims are children, and human trafficking generates about $150 billion per year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Where Does the Money Go?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The funds that advocates raise for Dressember are distributed to Dressember's partner organizations to fund vital anti-trafficking work worldwide. Through advocacy, prevention work (stopping it before it starts), intervention (reaching those in need), and survivor empowerment programs (comprehensive care for survivors), Dressember is working towards its vision of a world where all people are free. Get involved with Dressember at U of M if you are determined to fight for freedom and dignity!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Learn More</strong></p>\r\n<p>Watch the TEDx talk&nbsp;to hear from Dressember's founder, Blythe Hill, about how a dress (or tie) can change the world.

However, this is not only limited to just underrepresented communities but for people who are passionate and interested in breaking into the fashion industry. We want our members to feel that they aren&rsquo;t just another diversity token, but to feel that they can simply exist within fashion without having to explain their existence whether that be being BIPOC or Queer or both as examples of completing our mission of inclusion.

All the hard work paid off each and every year, as FunKtion quickly grew into a recognizable entity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>FunKtion has been invited to perform at various events such as Festifall, A Taste of Culture, Encompass, Dance Marathon, Michigan Homecoming, Greek Week, KSA, Sixth Day, Celebrasia, Noir Fashion Show, Pioneer High School, 58 Greene concerts, Dance Mix, and a Detroit Pistons game.&nbsp;In its short history, FunKtion has traveled from the Midwest (UIUC, GVSU, Northwestern, opening for Jocelyn Enriquez) to the East Coast (Columbia for ECASU), opening for JCole. and it only gets bigger as FunKtion continually works to expand its repertoire and its presence.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The FunKtion family is reaching towards you with open arms and shuffling feet. Come support us wherever the bass reverberates and the boys dance.</p>\r\n<p><br />We dance. You scream. FunKtion on three...</p>",
        "Summary": "We are FunKtion, University of Michigan's first all-male, multicultural, hip-hop dance group. Founded on the principles of brotherhood, dance, and entertainment, we promote the joy and the welfare of the University's diverse community.",

        "Description": "<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">It all began in early 1997 when a group of University of Michigan Arts Chorale members got together to sing some a cappella music. After much debate and many poetry recitations, the group adopted the name \"Gimble in the Wabe\" from Lewis Carroll's poem,&nbsp;Jabberwocky. Since first performing in April of 1998, the group&rsquo;s name has been refined to Gimble A Cappella, and has evolved into the self-proclaimed quirkiest a cappella group on campus! Each year, Gimblers unite to host 3 concerts and can frequently be seen performing at various events on campus and around the country during their annual spring tour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Gimble released 7 studio albums on CD before their recent releases on streaming platforms. In 2017, they released a 4-song EP, &ldquo;XX,&rdquo; in celebration of their 20th anniversary. Featuring hits like &ldquo;If I Go&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with You&rdquo;, it motivated a wave of new releases. Singles &ldquo;Dancing On My Own&rdquo; and &ldquo;715 - CR&sum;&sum;KS&rdquo; debuted in 2018, followed by &ldquo;Fallingwater&rdquo; and &ldquo;when the party&rsquo;s over&rdquo; late in 2019. In 2020, they released their 5-song EP &ldquo;home,&rdquo; aptly named both for the home they shared together and the unmistakable familial atmosphere of the group. Shortly thereafter, Gimble returned with powerhouse covers of Brandi Carlile's \"The Joke\" and Hozier's \"Movement\". Gimble is excited to continue recording their original arrangements for many years to come!</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Going strong in its 27th year, Gimble A Cappella continues the tradition with a few fresh faces and a continued passion for a cappella music.

We help run nutrition workshops, their community gardening program, and youth education programs in order to provide healthy food and nutrition education to the community. We also partner with Green Umbrella school in the Putsor Community near Phnom Penh, Cambodia, which believes in the potential of today's youth. Green Umbrella provides quality education to disenfranchised families, in order to achieve sustainable development, facilitates leadership programs to enhance confidence and unity within the community, and leads livelihood workshops for adults and English classes for children. We raise an annual amount of $6,000 for our international partner and assist with their assessment research and education modeling during our 3-week long trip every summer. At our Monday night meetings, we plan fundraising and volunteer events and hold discussion-based lessons about public health issues.</p>\r\n<p>As a Global Health Alliance chapter, we have partnered with student organizations at MIT, UChicago, UW-Madison, and Tufts to create a collaborative network of clubs with similar goals.&nbsp; We share ideas in order to create the best organizations at our respective campuses; however, all of our fundraising, partnerships, and general meetings are managed separately.</p>",

We offer special seminars, courses, and direct involvement with faculty from the start of students' lives at Michigan. Students are expected to elect half their course work in Honors; many do more. Many Honors students participate in research during their first two years, and almost all Honors seniors pursue their own independent research projects under the guidance of a faculty mentor, leading to an Honors senior thesis.</p>\r\n<p>To help students take the greatest advantage of the rich opportunities at Michigan, Honors advisors meet with them individually, beginning at Orientation and continuing throughout their time here.</p>\r\n<h3>Honors Community</h3>\r\n<p>A vibrant community, no single experience unites all Honors students, yet all are connected through a wide range of activities that enable students to choose what interests them. The Perlman Honors Commons is an intellectual hub, located on the ground floor of Mason Hall (above the Honors offices) where students and faculty come together for study, conversation, and a variety of intellectual and cultural events in truly beautiful surroundings.&nbsp;Organized by the Honor's Resident Advisors (HRAs), you will find students attending musicals, sports events, and visiting coffee hours. Faculty Fellows engage Honors students in a wide variety of ways outside of formal classes. There's something for everyone and all are invited.</p>",

With the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gift of Sight</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> program, Humanity First USA has assisted in restoring the vision of people living in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guatemala.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>What is Gift of Health?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gift of Health is an initiative that gives high-school, undergrad, and medical students the opportunity to get hands-on experience working to alleviate global health disparities in rural communities of Guatemala while providing free health care services, education, and medicines.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since our launch in 2012, we have provided primary care, pediatric and dental services, and medicines to 77,000+ adults and children in Guatemala. This trip is part of a broader vision of reaching out and providing health care in remote villages, where people in addition to other basic life necessities, are also deprived of preventive and medical needs. We are fortunate that some experienced healthcare professionals will be accompanying us, as well as a group of enthusiastic volunteers, including students from various universities across America.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>What is The Education Project?</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Education Project is an organization currently aligned under Humanity First USA, a 501c(3) non-profit. They are essentially a branch of Humanity First's education initiatives.

This is a sustainable solution for alleviating a global lack of supplies for those who have vision impairment but don&rsquo;t have access to corrective lenses. The glasses will be shipped to a team of experienced medical professionals who work as part of the Gift of Sight initiative to be distributed to vulnerable communities internationally.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our plan is to set up donation boxes in common meeting places and eye clinics on/near campus and monitor them on a monthly basis. Each month, we collect the glasses, ship them to a nearby processing center partnered with HF that measures them using a lensometer free of charge, and packages the frames to be shipped.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong>Our Mission at The University of Michigan</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are a platform that provides students with the opportunity to work with communities and individuals affected by natural disasters, conflict, and poverty both locally and abroad. To this end, we want to offer a variety of clinical and non-clinical volunteer opportunities to students on campus to get involved with what they are passionate about. Additionally, we aim to provide students with invaluable skills and experiences to develop into tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders through services aimed towards social and professional development, skills enhancement programs, and recognition for their services.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our current goals as a student organization are to:</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundraise for and coordinate a trip to Guatemala under the Gift of Health initiative from December 17-23rd, 2023</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recruit more undergraduate tutors for the Education Project</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Form school partnerships with the Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti school districts</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create donation boxes for used glasses frames/lenses in the local Ann Arbor community</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are interested in joining our team, please email us!!</span></p>",

We were established in 1932 by students and since that time we have successfully provided affordable, quality housing to thousands of students from around the world.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;\">Today approximately 550 members belong to our co-op and they collectively own and manage 21 properties. The properties are comprised of 16 houses, of these properties are the houses that we live in and the the Moses Coady/Paulo Friere Education Center for our members and the community and the Rochdale Center office space for both our members and staff.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;\">Students created the co-ops to meet their own needs, thus the ICC offers eight month Fall/Winter, 4 month Fall or Winter, and 2 or 4 month Spring/Summer contracts. Our houses range in size from 12 to 180 members. The average Central Campus house holds about 30 people.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;\">Escher Co-op on North Campus attracts a large graduate student population and a sizable international student population. The Central Campus co-ops are home to is a large, diverse crowd. Because co-ops are open to all students, each house is made up of members from a&nbsp; wide variety of backgrounds, interests, and academic programs. What brings us together is our dedication to create the best living atmosphere possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;\">Most houses are quite social. There are often ICC-wide parties at one house or another. Houses get&nbsp;together to play IM soccer, go apple picking, bowling, or ice skating&mdash;the list goes on and on.</p>\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 10px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;\">The ICC houses are more than just places to sleep and eat.&nbsp; Though our mission commits us to affordable housing, for many of our members it is the community that makes all the difference.&nbsp;</p>",

        "Description": "<p><strong>Judo (\u67d4\u9053)</strong> is a modern grappling martial art and combat sport that originated in Japan. Judo means \"the gentle way\" in Japanese, reflecting its emphasis on using an opponent's force and movements to one's advantage rather than opposing them with brute strength. Its techniques primarily involve throws, pins, joint locks, and strangles. Judo is not only a martial art but also an <strong>Olympic sport</strong> since 1964. Judo is one of the most popular sports in the world with 128 participating nations in the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games compared to Wrestling at 61&nbsp; participating nations.<br /><br />At <strong>Judo at Michigan (JAM)</strong>, students have the opportunity to learn and practice the sport of Judo. They will acquire essential self-defense skills, improve their physical fitness, and develop mental discipline. As an official sport club, we compete at tournaments (not mandatory, although highly encouraged) across Michigan and offer leadership opportunities. Our club provides a welcoming and inclusive environment for students of all skill levels, from beginners to experienced practitioners.<br /><br /><strong>Safety</strong> is a priority, hence, members with no experience, they will first be taught how to fall before getting any combat involvement. Ukemi (\u53d7\u8eab), known as the art of falling safely and efficiently, will teach you several core principles, including relaxation, proper body positioning (such as not posting on your hands or elbows), and controlled breathing, to dissipate the energy of a throw or fall, reducing the risk of injury.<br /><br />Then, students will practice <strong>throwing</strong> and <strong>grappling </strong>techniques.<br /><br /><strong>Schedule:</strong> Judo training sessions take place on Wednesday (7:30-9:30 PM), Saturday (3:00-5:00 PM), and Sunday (2:00-4:00 PM). Wednesday and Saturday will have structured instructions, while Sunday is an open mat, in which any technique can be practiced. Practices will start off with warm-ups and Ukemi practice. Next, throws will be practiced. Afterward, we will do randori (sparring) or learn new ground techniques. Finally, we will do a short cooldown.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/pgfKasoI5yc\">https://youtu.be/pgfKasoI5yc</a></p>\r\n<p>Paralympic Judo for the deaf and visually impaired</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/JWr41lpfLMc\">https://youtu.be/JWr41lpfLMc</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/jiuuTbfn-1E\">https://youtu.be/jiuuTbfn-1E</a></p>",

During these workshops, we teach developmentally appropriate cooking skills and nutrition to children ranging from ages 3-14. We develop lesson plans using recipes with ingredients that are familiar, nutritious, and inexpensive. Our lesson plans generate excitement for healthy food, as well as curiosity about what makes food good for us and why we need to eat healthfully. We plan hands-on activities that allow the children to do the preparation and cooking themselves. This independence and agency empowers the kids to become engaged in and take ownership of what they are putting into their bodies.

        "Description": "<p>On December 1, 1975, history was made &ndash; history on a college campus, which would transcend other colleges/universities throughout the United States; history which would have a positive impact on the Latino community and our nation; history which would forever change the Greek system, more specifically, the entity known as a fraternity. On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campus of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.<br /><br />In 1975, there were no Latino fraternities in existence in the United States. The Greek-letter organizations of the time primarily catered to Anglo and African-American students and graduates. Lambda&rsquo;s founders, as men of vision, realized there was a need to unite the Latino students, develop their leadership skills, impart upon them the value of an education, and instill in them a commitment to their community and culture. The traditional student club would not suffice to accomplish such lofty goals. Hence, Latino unity and brotherhood would be achieved through a long recognized institution &ndash; the fraternity. This newest addition to the Greek system would be the first in the nation, by identity and by name: Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Incorporated.<br /><br />The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the undergraduate level, our brothers are active within the Fraternity and in other student organizations. Our brothers perform community service, promote our culture by sponsoring events which highlight and celebrate our heritage, participate in educational workshops, and enjoy many social programs. As a result of their active participation in every aspect of college life, our undergraduates are developing their organizational, communication, and leadership skills, all while pursuing the coveted diploma. Our younger Lambdas are receiving the training and competence to serve as the future leaders of our brotherhood, community, and nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />At the professional level, among our ranks you will find attorneys, doctors, and engineers. Our brothers are shaping young minds as educators and as dedicated fathers. The men in brown and white are defending this country at home and abroad in the area of law enforcement and in the armed forces. We are strengthening our country&rsquo;s economy as entrepreneurs. Our brothers are teaching leadership as coaches, mentors, and community activists. The Lambdas are affecting policy and change as elected officials serving on City Councils, Boards of Education, U.S. House of Representatives, and U.S. Senate. In short, Lambdas are contributing and excelling in every facet of human endeavor.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our illustrious history is not only our past but our guiding light to the future. As the first, we overcame many obstacles. Not having much guidance in our formative stages, we persevered and became stronger. Lambda is the product of vision, strength, and unity. Our history serves as a legacy and testament to our accomplishments and greatness.<br /><br />Lambda Theta Phi &hellip; Academic Excellence &ndash; Brotherhood &ndash; Leadership &ndash; Latino Unity -Service.</p>",

The discipline of linguistics takes this central role of language as its starting point.

The Department of Linguistics at the University of Michigan is one of the few departments in the United States that captures the inherent breadth of the discipline by exploring the cognitive, interactional, cultural, and developmental aspects of language.

They chose to focus on hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), more commonly referred to as neonatal asphyxia; a condition that is one of the leading causes of death for newborns. Research identified hypothermia therapy as the only medical intervention shown to improve infant brain function, and so they set a goal: to design a device that would safely and effectively apply the therapy to mitigate the complications associated with the condition. Since then, NAP has grown into a multidisciplinary team of students who continue to work to achieve this goal. We are currently designing and building different device prototypes.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>Under anesthesia required for surgical procedures, a patient experiences vasodilation and loses the ability to properly regulate their body temperature, causing a core-to-peripheral redistribution of body heat. If core body temperature drops below 36.0 \u2103, it becomes perioperative hypothermia, which may lead to cardiac events, impaired pharmacodynamics, increased risk of infection, excess blood loss, and even organ failure. In turn, this creates worsened patient outcomes, prolonged hospitalization time, and increased medical expenses. Perioperative hypothermia has been reported to affect about 70% of surgical patients, thus establishing a need for an active warming system to prevent it from occurring. Through a needs assessment conducted in the Dominican Republic in Spring 2022, our team found that many healthcare systems across the country lack effective methods for maintaining patient core body temperature during surgeries. Current solutions used in the United States are expensive, non-reusable, and require manual controls, making it difficult to implement them in the Dominican Republic. Thus, based on our needs assessment and additional feedback from advisors, our team is currently developing a reusable, low-cost heated mattress element with an automatic control system to adjust mattress temperature in response to feedback from non-invasive core body temperature readings.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is a need for a method of regulating patient core body temperature during surgery to prevent perioperative hypothermia and the ensuing complications that arise in low-resource hospitals. Thus, our team&rsquo;s mission is to provide a safe, effective, affordable, and reusable solution to allow healthcare systems across the Dominican Republic to effortlessly maintain patient core body temperature during surgery, resulting in improved patient outcomes and a reduced financial burden for both hospitals and patients. Specifically, our team strives to give operating rooms the ability to monitor core body temperature and maintain normothermia in patients during surgical procedures to prevent complications and discomfort that may arise as a result of perioperative hypothermia.</p>",

        "Description": "<p>In 2008, WHO estimated that 1.5 million deaths among children under 5 years were due to vaccine-preventable diseases. Immunization systems in low-resource areas are unsustainable due to a lack of electricity, unreliable transportation, and gaps in the vaccine supply chain. The Solar Fridge is an inexpensive, low-maintenance vaccine storage refrigerator for long-term, on-site vaccine storage that ensures the safety and viability of vaccines in low-resource communities. Between 2008 and 2012, this project transitioned between different departments and teams. Although the general focus of vaccine sustainability has persisted, the user needs and target population were either lost or not found. Therefore, the project has recently focused efforts on the reevaluation of its needs assessment approach. During the summer of 2017, our team performed a problem definition trip with our community partners in Rincon Claro--a small village in the Dominican Republic. We learned that the greatest problem they are facing is on-site vaccine storage, making the Solar Fridge a perfect fit. We also visited other communities and validated this as an overarching problem in this region. This trip has helped Solar Fridge in re-establishing a need, allowing for future progress towards improving vaccine sustainability. Currently, we are pursuing a design using a battery charged with grid and solar power to run a vaccine refrigerator while also working with a design using adsorption refrigeration.</p>",

Based on observations made at local clinics and interviews with doctors, patients, community members, and other healthcare workers, DRIP chose to focus on a major health concern in the Puerto Pe&ntilde;asco community: diabetes. Diabetes has been a growing concern in this local community, and in most of Mexico, particularly surrounding wound care education and access to assistive walking devices for diabetic amputees. This year, DRIP began developing a prototype for a prosthetic device and an educational vehicle. In the future, DRIP plans to visit Puerto Pe&ntilde;asco to further develop connections to the community and receive feedback on our current technical and educational proposed solutions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">DRIP is split into a technical subteam and an educational subteam.

Our design considerations are grounded in our collaboration with an experienced emergency nurse at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, consultation with the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Center for Socially Engaged Design, and literature review. Our members have traveled abroad on M-HEAL&rsquo;s Service and Needs Assessment trip to Guatemala and the University of Michigan&rsquo;s Global Health Design Initiative trip to Ghana. These experiences granted insight on specific IV administration needs. We have used our findings to develop requirements, specifications, and an array of possible solutions for our IV drip monitoring and controlling solution and have narrowed our scope to several introductory solutions.

There are three components which also provide the structure for the three subteams within The Initiative: bassinet, heating pad, and KC carrier. The bassinet houses the heating pad and is the standalone component of the device. The heating pad is the external heating method, and uses a resistive wire to generate heat and a control system to monitor heat output and maintain the system temperature at 37 degrees Celsius. The KC carrier is the wearable component that supports skin-to-skin contact. This component has been mostly developed, and is moving into a more marketing/business focused phase. These three components combine together into a cohesive device that aims to provide continuous warmth from two different heat sources. Through our hybrid infant warmer, we hope to globally eliminate mortality in low birth weight infants and provide families the opportunity to grow and thrive.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LEARN MORE ON OUR WEBSITE:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mheal.engin.umich.edu/theinitiative\">http://mheal.engin.umich.edu/theinitiative</a></span></p>",

MHacks is for creators.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_subpage-text\">Students spend 36 hours building anything they can imagine, and take breaks to interact with technology visionaries, meet founders, and find new mentors. They meet with the most sought-after companies in the world who vie for hackers' attention. For MHacks, students give up a weekend of partying to invest a weekend in their personal growth by learning something new, and creating solutions to problems they see in the world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_subpage-text\">MHacks isn't just a hackathon, it's a community of people who have ideas and build them.</p>\r\n</div>",

While all three pillars are appreciated equally, House members have consistently prided themselves on being the leaders and best in academics at the University of Michigan. This spirit appears in house life as well, where the intellectual inquiry manifests itself in the form of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Pubspeaks (student presentations on any topic you are knowledgable on and wish)</li>\r\n<li>Faculty Forums (similar to PubSpeaks, but for&nbsp;resident&nbsp;faculty)</li>\r\n<li>Documentary screenings</li>\r\n<li>Guest speakers and lecture series</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Community service</strong></span> is our second pillar. Through House projects, members of the Telluride House come together to make a difference in their community while also furthering the goals of the house and the association. Projects change from year to year, but have in the past included high school tutoring with Peace Neighborhood Center, working with political refugees in Detroit, or meal preparation at Food Gatherers.</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Self-governance</span></strong> is our third pillar at Telluride House. Our autonomy and practice of self-governance is a unique aspect of the house in comparison to other organizations at the University of Michigan. At Telluride House, self-governance means&hellip;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>House meetings, following Robert's Rules of Order, where students make administrative and budgetary decisions about the house processes</li>\r\n<li>Committee work (Entertainment Committee, Logistics Committee, Advisory Committee, and Recruitment Committee.</li>\r\n<li>Democratic development and selection of our community service project</li>\r\n<li>Democratic selection of new house members and faculty guests, through application review for two, yearly cycles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Whether sitting in House meetings, working in a committee, or amending the by-laws, there are countless opportunities for and experiences with leadership and self-governance inherent in house life.</p>\r\n<p>Other benefits of the fellowship include (but are not limited to): Miscellaneous funds allocated for house improvements, events and outings, snacks and beverage preferences, streaming service and magazine subscriptions; exposure and mentorship from other members across diverse fields (Medicine, Law, Social Work, Engineering, Philosophy, History, etc.); freshly cooked meals from a personal chef, each day; fully furnished rooms; lifetime membership to the Telluride Association; opportunities for grants and funding associated with community service, thesis writing; a home gym, free parking/parking passes, and more.</p>\r\n</div>",

Rather,&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;fraternity was established as a means to create a close-knit community of like-minded men that focused their efforts on&nbsp;<em>several</em>&nbsp;core aspects of life and strived to achieve the perfect balance between work, play, and service to the community.</p>\r\n<p>So what&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;Triangle Fraternity? At the University of Michigan, Triangle is a community of various students studying technical programs, such as engineering, biology, neuroscience, and architecture, centered around its chapter home and its core values. The members strive for the balanced lifestyle and forge lifelong friendships along the way. At the national level, Triangle Fraternity is an organization that seeks to develop men as leaders and create a widespread network of individuals dedicated to personal growth, brotherhood, and their professional interests.</p>\r\n<p>Each member joins Triangle for a different reason, but&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;member is able to find an atmosphere which fosters friendship and academic, social, and professional growth.</p>",

MI DNA Day provides a unique opportunity for high school students to meet and interact with young scientists, which often clarifies misconceptions of what a scientist looks like and breaks down barriers for students to follow scientific career paths. Scientist ambassadors also discuss their own ongoing research with students and share exciting career opportunities in science and biotechnology. Moreover, MI DNA Day allows early-career scientists to share their passion for science with students, fostering a spirit of public engagement leading to continued participation in science outreach throughout their careers.</p>\r\n<p>MI DNA Day takes its name from National DNA Day, which was created to commemorate the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 and the discovery of DNA&rsquo;s double helix in 1953. There are currently six other states with their own DNA Day programs, and we are ecstatic that Michigan is now on that growing list!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

We have also recently partnered with HVA to assist in a volunteer program in which non-certified members can assist EMTs at local U of M events and ride along in an ambulance to spark further interest in becoming a first responder.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the academic year, the club hosts monthly mass meetings where members get together to announce updates, collaborate on projects, and learn various prehospital skills. In these meetings, members can learn about research and further career opportunities. Many members now work on the M-RISE project, which aims to improve neurological outcomes following cardiac arrest, and the Toyota Drone Study, which seeks ways to improve the accessibility of EMS supplies in the field via the use of a drone. MEMSC also aims to increase career interest in meetings by bringing in a variety of guest speakers. Over the past 2 years, MEMSC has been pleased to host guest speakers with many agencies and individuals including: Ann Arbor Fire Department, HVA Dispatch, HVA Public Relations, HVA MICU paramedics, the Washtenaw/Livingston Medical Control Authority, Washtenaw County Hazmat, and multiple medical students completing residency in emergency medicine. Guest Speakers give presentations, offer advice, and bring in interactive medical equipment to spark greater interest in emergency medicine/EMS. Through the various opportunities we provide at MEMSC, we hope to build and foster interest in the prehospital field of medicine.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",

        "Description": "<p>Michigan Games and Cards is a casual club that meets to play board games, card games, bluffing games, and more at weekly game nights. We also host occasional events like murder mysteries and tournaments. We strive to be a welcoming, casual, and safe community for all UofM students to play games.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>When and where do you meet?</em></p>\r\n<p>We meet for game nights every Tuesday and Friday on the third floor of Mason Hall starting at 6pm and going until whenever. We usually get 30+ people at game nights, and have gotten more than 100 at mass meetings. We also have occasional events during game nights or on weekends.</p>\r\n<p>Sign up for the email list to get a weekly email with specific room numbers, events notifications, and links to join GroupMe and Discord:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/vWCxxGR2C2Pz4Wc79\">https://forms.gle/vWCxxGR2C2Pz4Wc79</a></p>\r\n<p><br /><em>How do I join the club?</em></p>\r\n<p>Show up to a meeting! There&rsquo;s no formal membership or attendance policy, and all UofM students are welcome. You&rsquo;re also free to invite non-students.</p>\r\n<p>We use GroupMe (primary) and Discord (secondary) as club discussion and meme pages and for announcements. You&rsquo;ll get a link to those from any of our emails when you've joined the email list. (and also room locations, event details, etc.)</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/vWCxxGR2C2Pz4Wc79\">https://forms.gle/vWCxxGR2C2Pz4Wc79</a> (a link so good we wrote it twice)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Who owns the games?</em></p>\r\n<p>You do! The club doesn't currently own its own games; everyone brings games and forms groups. Just show up, grab a game and a group, and play! And if you don't know what to do, ask anyone who's there. We're a very welcoming club; so long as you're up to try something new, you'll be able to fit in.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>So what kinds of games do you play?</em></p>\r\n<p>All Kinds! Here&rsquo;s a few:</p>\r\n<p><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Social Deduction</span> - Secret Hitler, Blood on the Clocktower, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, The Resistance/Avalon, Werewords<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Bluffing</span> - Skull, Coup, B.S., Sheriff of Nottingham, Masquerade<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Misc. Card Games</span> - Shards of Infinity, Skull King, Whist, Love Letter, Uno, Mao, Tournament at Avalon, President<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Cooperative</span> - Hanabi, Spirit Island, The Mind, Pandemic, Spaceteam, The Crew<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Team-based</span> - Codenames, Euchre, Decrypto, Fog of Love<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Dexterity</span> - Jenga, Klask, Egyptian Rat Screw, Pit, Big Jenga, Fuse<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Party Games</span> - Monikers, Wavelength, We Didn&rsquo;t Playtest This at All, Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza<br /><strong class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_header-char\">&bull; </strong>&nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Strategy/Other</span> - Catan, Ticket to Ride, Crytpid, Isle of Skye, Splendor, Clank, Bohnanza, Wingspan</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>What do you not play?</em></p>\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t really play trading card games like Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh, nor do we do much casual video-gaming like smash bros, although these aren&rsquo;t off the table, they&rsquo;re just not our vibe. You&rsquo;d have more luck with these at the Casual Gaming Club.</p>\r\n<p>We also don&rsquo;t do much D&amp;D type role-playing or organize longer campaign-y games. You should head to the Tabletop Gaming Club for that.</p>\r\n<p>There are also dedicated clubs for chess and euchre, although we play both occasionally.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>What&rsquo;s your commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion?</em></p>\r\n<p>We have a dedicated DEI Committee whose goal is to help ensure all members and attendees feel safe and welcome at the club, and that will monitor an anonymous form for attendees to bring up any issues or concerns. In general the club is committed to keeping our community free of discrimination, harrassment, and bullying of any kind, in any form.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>It&rsquo;s free right?</em></p>\r\n<p>Mostly Yes! Showing up to weekly game nights and playing games is entirely free. We do ask that you pay a dues fee for certain events, usually anything where members bring food or use gas to drive somewhere, but also for participating in the biweekly tournaments. However, dues are only $1-5 per semester, your choice. We also often accept bringing food or snacks for members as paying dues.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>What types of events?</em></p>\r\n<p>Most common is our once every three weekly tournaments, where we have small, optional, tournaments during regular game nights of different games with the winner earning pride and bragging rights. Other events we do during game nights include pot lucks, movie nights, de-stress days (coloring sheets &amp; nail painting), and holiday events like gift exchanges or costume contests. We also do stuff outside normal game nights like murder mystery nights put together by our members, or trips to places like cider mills or ice-skating rinks.</p>\r\n<p>The events committee is also very open, so you should speak up if you have any ideas or want to help run something!</p>\r\n<p><br /><em>Where do I ask other questions?</em></p>\r\n<p>You should send an email to <a href=\"mailto:gamesboard@umich.edu\">gamesboard@umich.edu</a> if you have specific questions. It&rsquo;ll reach everyone on the executive board.</p>\r\n<p>You could also read our constitution; it's linked below. It details the club's purpose and commitments and also the executive board structure and election procedure.</p>",

We offer concerts, lectures, films, classes, community service, yoga, religious services, discussion groups, dialogue, free Shabbat dinners, and a full kosher meal program. We also take more students to Israel on Taglit-Birthright Israel than any other Hillel in the country.</p>\r\n<p>You can come to Hillel to hang out, catch a movie, eat delicious meals, study, hold a group meeting or do yoga. But Hillel is not just confined to our building.&nbsp; You can experience Hillel in coffee shops, in residence halls, on the diag, in your own home, in Israel or in Detroit.&nbsp; Drop in or contact us to learn more about how to get connected. Or come to us with a new idea we can help you grow for your community.&nbsp; Hillel is what you make it.</p>",
        "Summary": "Hillel is the center of Jewish life at the University of Michigan, supporting a vibrant and diverse community. Hillel is home to more than 60 student groups that create hundreds of ways to get involved in Jewish life on campus.",

        "Description": "<p>Founded in 1998, Michigan Interactive Investments (MII) is a highly selective, leading undergraduate investment club at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business. Each year, MII builds an investment portfolio with the goal of educating members about investing through interactive portfolio management. By maintaining a small, dedicated member base of approximately 60 undergraduate students, MII is able to effectively teach members about investing in a variety of equity, fixed income, and derivative securities. MII is unique in that we manage a $25,000 student-run portfolio. We have complete freedom over our investment strategies and asset classes, which include long/short equity, fixed income, and currencies.</p>\r\n<p>MII utilizes a multifaceted investment strategy involving both fundamental and quantitative analysis to invest in equities, options, and fixed income instruments. We take a disciplined approach to investing, focused on a medium-term outlook for attractive returns while preserving capital. Furthermore, we primarily use a bottom-up approach to source investment ideas, while also implementing top-down and quantitative screening strategies to identify opportunities that will outperform our S&amp;P 500 index benchmark. Additionally, we supplement this fundamental approach to investment selection with technical analysis to identify appropriate entry and exit points for our positions.</p>\r\n<p>MII also provides many resources to help members secure internship and full-time job placements, and hosts the Undergraduate Investment Conference (UIC) each fall. The UIC invites participants from over 20 of the top universities in the country for a featured stock pitch competition. The winner is awarded an approximately $3,000 grand prize, and the Conference includes a keynote speaker and the opportunity for students and corporate partners to meet and network.</p>\r\n<p>We pride ourselves on MII&rsquo;s three core pillars: Education, Investing, and Professional Development.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Education</strong></p>\r\n<p>An important goal of MII is to educate members about investing and strengthen their knowledge of financial markets. This goal is comprised of three parts: First, new members have the opportunity to attend &ldquo;Breakfast Club&rdquo; sessions to learn the basics of investing, including how to source investments, value firms, and use financial data tools. Second, senior members make presentations during club meetings on more advanced topics, such as distressed debt investing, options valuation, and monetary policy. Third, every meeting features a market update that provides members with a better understanding of current economic conditions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Investing</strong></p>\r\n<p>MII builds a student run portfolio through a process in which members evaluate market sectors and pitch their best investment ideas. After the pitch, members vote on whether the security should be added to MII&rsquo;s portfolio. Profits are reinvested into the club, either towards growing the size of the portfolio or funding special events throughout the year.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Professional Development</strong></p>\r\n<p>Our members are high performing. Graduating seniors have gone off into a variety of firms on both the sell side and buy side. The following list omits many firms, but on the sell side, members have gone on to work for Deutsche Bank, Evercore, Guggenheim Partners, Goldman Sachs, M. Klein &amp; Copmany, Moelis &amp; Company, Morgan Stanley, PJT Partners, The Raine Group, Royal Bank of Canada, and Rothschild Global Financial Advisory. On the buy side, members have worked for Ares, Apollo, Bridgewater, Insight Venture Partners, KKR, and Prudential Capital. As such, members can expect an extensive network that can open many doors during recruiting season.</p>",

MJAS is committed to contributing to the larger&nbsp;community of scholarship through our open-access website. MJAS accepts submissions&nbsp;from around the globe in the social sciences and humanities concerning Asian studies. Where opportunities exist, other journals confine their dialogues so narrowly as to include only one region, which consequently limits discussions that transcend regional&nbsp;boundaries. MJAS supports a broader scope of Asian culture, which consequently allows&nbsp;MJAS to accept more submissions and publish more frequently. Furthermore, it is the&nbsp;intention of MJAS to deepen appreciation and encourage interest into the rich and diverse&nbsp;cultures found in greater Asia, which is facilitated by affording students the venues in&nbsp;which to participate in the discussion.</p>\r\n<p>Besides appealing to those students who wish to publish, MJAS is useful for&nbsp;students at large in the field because MJAS archives its publications online, free to the&nbsp;public. With respect to MJAS&rsquo;s component on campus, MJAS wishes to manifest its&nbsp;presence through hosting various meetings: recruitment for both editors and would-be&nbsp;authors; mini-presentations from students preparing research projects; and appearances&nbsp;by professors to lecture or discuss their current research in the field of Asian studies.</p>",

Please see email that goes out every week for room. <br /><br />When: 6-8pm every Wednesday<br /><br />What: We teach students how to knit and/or crochet. All projects made with club supplies are donated to those in need. During weekly meetings, students knit, crochet, and converse for two hours. Meetings are not mandatory. The club provides all knitting/crocheting supplies (yarn, needles, crochet hooks, etc). To take a project home, a deposit of $5 for yarn and $5 for the needles/crochet hook ($10 total) is required. The money is returned after the completion of the project. This way, students who want to learn to knit/crochet can without needing to invest money in supplies. We accept students of all skill levels, from I-have-never-picked-up-yarn-before beginners to I-am-on-my-fifteenth-sweater experts. Although most projects are for charity donations, the club also welcomes folks who want to work on their own personal projects in a group setting. <br /><br />Why: Create goods to warm the local community and learn/expand crafty skills<br /><br />If you would like to set up a time to sign out materials, or if you want to donate items you have knit or crocheted (or items like food products or toiletries) to homeless shelters without joining Mknit, or for any other questions/comments/concerns, please feel free to contact Jillian Dore at jdore@umich.edu</p>",

Combining these two disciplines allows us to better understand life, and use that understanding to benefit society. Synthetic Biology is distinct from Genetic Engineering in that the latter only alters existing genes, whereas the former utilizes existing, modified, and man-made genes to make life perform useful functions not normally found in nature. Through synthetic biology, it may be possible to solve some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging problems such as energy shortage, environmental pollution, and disease. However, we must be wary of potential safety and ethical issues along the way.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>What is iGEM?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">iGEM is an international undergraduate synthetic biology competition. In 2015, iGEM consisted of 259 teams and 2700 participants from all over the world. Every year, teams research, design, construct, and test a novel biological system. Students have at their disposal bits of DNA from the iGEM Registry of Standard Biological parts to help aid them in building their biological &ldquo;machine&rdquo;. In addition, students are encouraged to build their own parts and develop new techniques to make life easier to engineer. Teams also help to increase awareness for synthetic biology through public outreach and analyze safety concerns as a part of the project design process. Projects are wide ranging and are divided into the following categories: Environment, Food and Nutrition, Energy, Foundational Advance, Health and Medicine, Information Processing, Manufacturing, Software Tools, and New Applications. For more information, see</span><a href=\"http://igem.org/Main_Page\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">igem.org</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1><strong>Who Can Join?</strong></h1>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any undergraduate student with an interest in synthetic biology and biological engineering is welcome to join! Absolutely no previous experience is required. In addition, we always have places for students interested in mathematical modeling, business, programming, web design, and animation. Our team is composed of undergraduate students from a variety of majors, including (but not limited to) Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Biomedical Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Mathematics, Biophysics, Neuroscience, Microbiology, Philosophy, and Materials Science &amp; Engineering. We also have graduate students and faculty advisors from multiple colleges and departments on campus. Students will become acquainted with the theory and techniques during weekly meetings from February to the end of Winter Semester, at which point we will transition to working on the year&rsquo;s project, continuing into the Spring, Summer, and following Fall Semester, until our competition in late October. To join, applications start in the middle of January!</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: Per iGEM rules, students over the age of 23 by March 31 may not perform work. They can however be advisors to the team. Students in a 5-year combined bachelor's/master's degree program who are not older than 23 are eligible to join!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

We are committed to establishing sustainable solutions to dismantle the barriers created by systems and furthering the academic success of menstruating people through advocacy programs that promote inclusivity and period equity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The University of Michigan chapter of Mission Menstruation believes that menstrual hygiene is a right, not a privilege. Academic institutions, upon being motivated by students, can address period poverty. With the belief that higher education institutions set the precedent for the way that many other institutions treat marginalized groups, working to educate and advocate for all students who menstruate on these campuses is the first step in making change for all people who have periods.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition to higher academic institutions, such as but not limited to universities, colleges, and conservatories, etc, the Michigan State Legislature, like sixteen other states (New York, Maryland, Illinois, etc), should take action to implement funding or mandatory budgeting within public school districts for menstrual product dispensers and free products.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Menstrual Poverty impacts numerous groups, however research showcases that women of low-income are most affected, followed by low-income students on university campuses. According to the ACLU, &ldquo;a recent study demonstrated that two-thirds of low-income women in St. Louis could not afford menstrual products during the previous year, instead using cloth, rags, diapers, or paper as a substitute&rdquo; (ACLU, 2023). Advocating for legislation and supporting groups with the highest rates of menstrual equity, is the most important goal of our chapter at the University of Michigan.</p>",
        "Summary": "Mission Menstruation seeks to increase access to free period products on Michigan\u2019s campus and in the greater communities of Washtenaw County. We advocate and work for solutions to period poverty and educate for individuals on menstrual equity",

In addition to daily practices, cross country meets, and track meets, we also have numerous social events and charity events throughout each semester! We have&nbsp;about 200 dues-paying members so there's always someone to run with! In the past we've traveled everywhere from Hershey, Pennsylvania, to Richmond, Virginia, for meets.</p>\r\n<p><br />Getting involved with MRun couldn't be easier--all you have to do is start showing up! During the fall we compete in Cross Country meets, and in the Winter/Spring, Track and Field. Beginning the first day of school in September we hold daily practices that offer a variety of running routes and distances. We meet outside the Central Campus Recreation Building (CCRB) on the walking bridge over Washtenaw Ave.&nbsp;every weekday at 4:15 PM where we will have usually a 3 mile, 5 mile, and 7 mile group go out for runs! We go to races about every other weekend during the Fall, and travel to locations anywhere from East Lansing, Michigan to Anderson, Indiana to Hershey, Pennsylvania. We also have a very successful Track and Field program so if you are not interested in long distance running, there are great opportunities for sprinting, jumping and throwing throughout the entire school year. There are track facilities available and practices and workouts for these events as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />However, the absolute best thing about MRun is that every practice, event, or anything is completely optional. You can come as much as you want! We have people who show up every day, and others once a month--it's entirely up to you!</p>\r\n<p><br />As for social events and charity events, nobody does them better than MRun. During the beginning of the year, we have a bunch of events to help new members (especially Freshmen) get to know everyone in the club. We often joke that we're really just a giant \"MRun family\" and we've been told that we're one of the most welcoming clubs on campus. Keep in contact with the club&nbsp;as the school year gets closer so&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;know more specifically when these events are! There will be a mass meeting, social events, and many other fun things&nbsp;going on first semester to make the transition into the club as easy and fun as possible!</p>",

It begins with a writer's room that will write all four, fifteen-minute episodes of our series. The scripts will feature four distinct characters, three locations, and limited stage directions and design suggestions. From there, four teams will each take on a different episode to design and produce. They will create an aesthetic that captures their interpretation of the world of the show, choosing locations and actors to complete their vision. In addition, each episode will include a custom, student-made theme song and poster which capture the team&rsquo;s artistic vision. Teams are not allowed to view other episodes before their episode is complete in an effort to make them as unique as possible. Our goal is to showcase a wide range of students&rsquo; creativity and to build a network across departments in the process. Once a team has completed their episode, it will be aired on our Youtube channel, @MultiverseMedia, for anyone and everyone to view. By the end of the semester, we will have our completed series uploaded to our Youtube channel for everyone to share and appreciate.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MM is established to share the talents of our students, create a network of artists, provide funded learning opportunities, and foster an environment that encourages curiosity and collaboration.

The club relies on volunteers to inquire about residents&rsquo; musical preferences and perform songs they would enjoy. All levels of expertise in instrument/vocals are welcome. MFD is a venue for volunteers to meet, form musical groups, and perform in front of an audience. UofM students mainly volunteer at the Brookdale and Orchard Hills care facilities in Ann Arbor, but we hope to expand to other facilities as well! Other sites are also available for those residing outside of Ann Arbor. Volunteer orientation is offered at the beginning of the semester and online workshops are provided throughout.</p>",

Since its founding, OTS has&nbsp;completed 63 schools.</p>\r\n<p>Honduras is the home of major cities like San Pedro Sula, where the murder rate and gang populations are high enough to consistently make them front page news on the New York Times and other prestigious US news sources. In 2009, Shin Fujiyama received a CNN Heroes award for his work in Honduras and appeared on shows like Larry King Live to explain the groundbreaking work One Thousand Schools was facilitating in Honduras.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>OTS is only able to build schools in Honduras through the fundraising and volunteering provided by high school and collegiate chapters in the United States.&nbsp;100% of&nbsp;funds&nbsp;donated by a chapter&nbsp;goes&nbsp;directly&nbsp;towards&nbsp;funding the construction of schools&nbsp;in Honduras. Members of those chapters have the opportunity to travel to Honduras and help build the schools they worked hard to raise money for. This is both an&nbsp;incredible&nbsp;learning experience for people and a great motivator for students to continue their fundraising efforts. OTS has a perfect safety record, and each member comes back with a changed perspective and enriched knowledge of life very different from theirs, as well as true hope for what can be accomplished through continued hard work in Honduras building schools and in the United States building chapters.</p>\r\n<p>The University of Michigan chapter of One Thousand Schools looks to build a community of passionate, strong-willed University of Michigan students who can help (1) build knowledge and awareness of the University of Michigan campus of the current issues being faced by Honduras and, as a consequence, how those issues translate to current border disputes and international politics, (2) raise money to build schools and donate school supplies to the communities working with SHH in Honduras, and (3) send volunteers on a safe and empowering service trip to Honduras at least once per year to participate in the building of these schools and to learn about the culture and people of Honduras.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This organization hopes to build a movement of young UM leaders with the collective goal of empowering and providing fundamental human needs to impoverished children and families in Honduras by promoting awareness through volunteerism and global responsibility.&nbsp;</p>",

You've probably heard horror stories about this daunting \"weed out course\" that seems to be the boogie man of college subjects. However, there are so many practical approaches to tackling it, and we want to share the most efficient ways to begin thinking like an orgo I student so that you aren't entering blindly in the fall. Our goal is not to give an overview of the whole course but to help you develop a strong understanding of what you are expected to learn from the start. By exposing yourself to organic chemistry early, you will feel way more comfortable in the large impersonal lectures. We will cover the basics of orgo I, such as understanding carbon skeletons, common terminology, resonance and bond length, and acid-base reactions.</span></p>",

We provide free and confidential advocacy and support for people who are undergraduates or graduate students at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. We can provide information to survivors about the Title IX process, including how to file and pursue a complaint, as well as rights under Title IX and University of Michigan&rsquo;s Sexual Misconduct Policy. We can also provide information and referrals for both internal and external supportive resources. If a survivor chooses to pursue a Title IX complaint, SAHLAS can also serve as a support person throughout the process. SAHLAS is also taking on a role in the policy sphere, helping to educate students at the University of Michigan on how to navigate the ever-changing Title IX policy. We also work very closely with University stakeholders to keep track of how the changes to the Federal Title IX policy are being implemented here at Michigan. Finally, SAHLAS conducts Know Your Rights trainings to educate University of Michigan students about their rights under Title IX and to empower individuals to access the supportive measures to which they are entitled.</p>",

Before a SASE chapter was started at the University of Michigan, there were many other ethnic scientific and engineering societies, but none that that truly represented those of Asian heritage. It was on this basis that the University of Michigan chapter of SASE was founded as well as the entire nationwide SASE community. The national SASE community was founded in 2007 by 10 Proctor and Gamble interns. Today, the SASE community spans across many colleges nationwide.</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Facebook:&nbsp;https://www.facebook.com/sase.umich</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Instagram:&nbsp;https://www.instagram.com/sase.michigan/</p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Slack:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">um-student-sase.slack.com</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"width: 665px;\">Website:&nbsp;http://www.umich.edu/~sase/</p>",

SRP was founded in 2013 in response to the tremendous need for free, high quality representation and support for students facing suspension and expulsion hearings in southeast Michigan. In all our activities, SRP seeks to keep students in school, learning, and out of the criminal justice system. Members of our organization become talented interviewers and oral advocates. They also develop zeal and cultural humility.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to advocating for students in disciplinary hearings, SRP advocates also:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>support community outreach and youth development work;</li>\r\n<li>lobby for youth&shy;-centered and restorative school discipline policies and laws;</li>\r\n<li>provide targeted special education support for students facing disciplinary exclusion due to disability &shy;related behaviors;</li>\r\n<li>engage in non-&shy;hearing advocacy in disciplinary matters; and</li>\r\n<li>host and attend events designed to educate the university and larger community about the school&shy;-to-&shy;prison pipeline in Michigan and best practices to oppose it.</li>\r\n<li>challenge institutional threats to educational opportunities for children.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A centerpiece of SRP is its interdisciplinary advocacy, combining the strengths of education, social work, policy, and law in order to promote positive outcomes for Michigan&rsquo;s youth. Our advocates are valued for their contributions to student advocacy, whether that be training in client interviewing, statutory research, or helping families access community resources. For this reason, each hearing advocacy is comprised of students from each discipline, insofar as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Since our founding, SRP has partnered with the Student Advocacy Center of Michigan (SAC) in the shared drive to end the school&shy;-to&shy;-prison pipeline in the state. SAC is a non&shy;profit educational advocacy organization headquartered in Ypsilanti, Michigan. SRP receives its referrals through SAC&rsquo;s intake process, and our case advocacy is supervised by an SAC attorney. Each organization supports the other in our collective youth justice efforts.</p>",

Our community partners experience limited access to clean water and storage, especially during the dry season. We have been working with both communities to improve in-home water access and water storage infrastructure. Our projects use recycled, discarded, and regionally accessible materials. We aim to create water infrastructure that is effective, sustainable, and environmentally responsible. The team is currently working to design gray water recycling systems and water pumps that community members in La Bolivarense and Olmedo can build and maintain themselves.

Students who are accepted into this program will be required to participate in community service experiences of their choosing, which we will then reflect upon as a group. Allowing students to choose their own experiences will allow for greater commitment on the individual student&rsquo;s part, as well as greater breadth of discussion.</p>\r\n<p>Small discussion-based seminars will be scheduled monthly.&nbsp; They are designed to supplement the service work, avoiding theory and abstraction, and focusing rather on the grounded, tangible knowledge and experiences of students and visiting speakers. For these seminar discussions a meal will be provided to be shared with the guest expert in an effort to encourage a discussion style format where the participants will be better able to ask questions and engage in the exchange of information.</p>\r\n<p>HESP will also complete site visits to community-engaged organizations such as FQHCs and other community organizing centers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Site-visits are essential for our members to gain exposure to successful organizations that are working towards improving health equity. Survey data from previous years shows site visits to be one of the most impactful aspects of HESP.&nbsp;Site-visits also facilitate networking and mentorship between students and administrators at the facilities. Such relationships have developed into research projects and independent site-visits from HESP members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Finally, student members will participate in volunteerism through their own efforts or through the medical school's existing programs.</p>",

Fill out our interest form for information about our mass meeting and to sign up for coffee chats (free coffee!) with team officers:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/RQ4nmRfPdG1tcrpG8\">https://forms.gle/RQ4nmRfPdG1tcrpG8</a></strong></p>\r\n<p>We are an engineering team that designs, fabricates, and programs a robotic surface vessel that can navigate obstacles and perform tasks on the open water all on its own with no human interaction. Working year-round, the team competes internationally against other autonomous boats every March in RoboNation's RoboBoat Competition in Sarasota, Florida. Last season, we took home 6th out of 28 teams, and won two awards - but this year, we're chasing the top.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our team is multidisciplinary, and has no barrier to entry - we encourage students from all different schools and colleges within the university with only a persistent curiosity and good spirits required. The goal of the team is to create a functional, efficient vessel while seeking out opportunities for learning and growth every step of the way.&nbsp;Bringing up questions and proposing adjustments are encouraged, as they help make a more cohesive team and a better overall product.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The team is split up into five main subteams: Mechanical, Electrical, AI, Advanced Capabilities, and Business.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The mechanical team designs and fabricates a new boat for competition each year, employing naval architecture and marine engineering principles to create resilient, waterproof hulls that can cut smoothly through the water, and a deck and superstructure that can support and protect the electronics housed within the boat. In addition, they provide support for mounting sensors onboard and help facilitate the boat's testing in the water in the Marine Hydrodynamics Laboratory. Students majoring in ME, NAME, ISME, RE, and many others can find their interests here!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our electrical team is responsible for all electronics onboard - they ensure that the boat has a reliable, safe electrical system capable of supporting the immense amount of software running on deck, which is crucial to our overall performance. Every year, they build a full computer capable of supporting our AI team's work, designing printed circuit boards (PCBs), and protecting everything in secure housing. Students majoring in Computer and Electrical Engineering, as well as those interested in integrated systems in general, are encouraged to join!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The AI team develops all of the boat's software, and consists of the bulk of our team - without them, our boat would simply be a sitting duck. Their team consists of multiple parts - Computer Vision, Task Planning, and Navigation/Controls. All of these make up a software pipeline that work in tandem to perceive tasks and obstacles, plan paths around or toward them, and navigate the boat according to that path. Computer Science and Robotics Engineering students, as well as anyone interested in programming, is encouraged to join!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Advanced Capabilities team is an interdisciplinary unit that works closely with other subteams to develop task-specific hardware and software that can vary wildly with the changes in competition challenges every year. Members work on specific mechanisms, and are responsible for everything from CAD, electronics, and embedded software, while ensuring integration with other subteams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, the Business team is what holds our team together - not only do they coordinate the finances and budget for the team, working to secure private sponsorships and manage funding, but they also market the team to the rest of the university and the world. Through outreach events, interaction with other teams and even some of our competition, to managing our technical documentation and presentation material for both our judges and the sponsors we work with, they ensure a unified brand and a team that can continue to reach new heights. While STEM students are highly encouraged, the business team also offers endless opportunities for those from any other discipline - everything from art, to writing, to business, to management is crucial to our team's success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Our team welcomes all, and encourages opportunities to learn, grow, and build the most important ship of all - friendship!&nbsp;If you have an interest in helping create an unmanned vessel, come join the team!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>More information can be found at <a title=\"UM::Autonomy\" href=\"https://www.umautonomy.com\"> www.umautonomy.com</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"UM::Autonomy 2023 Team Video\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxFV9WLaQ88\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxFV9WLaQ88</a></p>",

Our mission is to fight global health inequity by collecting, sorting, and shipping surplus medical supplies to areas in desperate need all around the world. Our volunteers can be found at World Medical Relief in Southfield, MI, where United 2 Heal is, and has long been, the #1 student organization and an important source of vital student leaders.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">We take pride in our shipments. United 2 Heal raises funds throughout the year and we use the money to sponsor the shipment of a 40'\u200b shipping container full of medical supplies from World Medical Relief in Southfield, MI to a country in need. Throughout our history, we have sent several shipments, totaling several millions of dollars of medical supplies, to several countries, including Ghana, Pakistan, and the Ivory Coast.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Most notably, United 2 Heal volunteers are among the first in the world to assist in the restoration of pacemaker devices for reuse. Between 1 and 2 million people die every year from lack of a pacemaker, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per device. As part of an ongoing and revolutionary clinical trial led by My Heart Your Heart, United 2 Heal volunteers are helping to make pacemaker restoration a reality. Ever since this groundbreaking work began for the first time at World Medical Relief in recent years, our volunteers have been working with My Heart Your Heart to interrogate, de-lead, and further process tens of thousands of pacemaker devices, each of which has the potential to save a life.</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_font_8\">Our community is primarily composed of students and alumni of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, but very recently&nbsp;United 2 Heal has founded new chapters at Wayne State University in Detroit, MI, at Oakland University in Rochester, MI, and at the University of Detroit - Mercy in Detroit, MI.&nbsp;United 2 Heal is composed of an Executive Board, a body of active members, and a large community of casual volunteers.

Founded in 1994 by three students: Danny Schwab, Scott Doyne, and Jeff Holzhausen, WOLV TV has evolved from simply covering Michigan Ice Hockey games to producing ten different shows and even partnering with the Big Ten Network to live-broadcast a range of Michigan sports!<br /><br />Where do our new members fit in? Everywhere! Each show successfully functions because of its crew. Crew members start at WOLV by being taught to operate a camera, run the TelePrompTer, mix the audio, run the switcher, edit highlights or packages, write scripts, conduct live interviews, or whatever job the show needs to run smoothly. We highly encourage new crew members to try many of these positions. Then, if a crew member decides to apply for a producer role and is selected, he or she will be responsible for passing on their knowledge to their new crew members.</p>\r\n<p>If you're interested in finding out more information, check out our website http://wolvtv.org or email join.wolv@umich.edu.</p>",

Young Americans for Freedom is a project of Young America's Foundation, which is a national non-profit organization which was founded in 1960 to develop and promote conservative ideas among our nation's young people. While the YAF chapter at the University of Michigan was originally founded decades ago, the chapter was reorganized in 2015 after being dormant for several years. Since then, the chapter has hosted the likes of Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, Michael Knowles, and other speakers, in addition to weekly meetings, tabling, and social events. Our chapter also won YAF Chapter of the Year in 2019.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><strong>What We Do</strong></h3>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas on campus through weekly meetings, speaking events, tabling, and social events.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Meetings</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter meetings are held on Tuesdays at 7 p.m. in Room D of the Michigan League. We typically discuss current issues and important conservative ideas as a group. Board members often give presentations on specific topics of interest to spur a deeper dive into the issues. Members and non-members are free to join us at our meetings to discuss the issues and meet fellow conservatives.</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Speakers</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas through speaking events each year. Our speaking events (typically one each semester) are designed to give U of M students the opportunity to hear from some of the most prominent and cutting edge conservative voices, as well as ask questions during the Q&amp;A portion of the event. Our events are always free and usually live streamed on YAF's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yafumich.com/youtube.com/YAFTV\">Youtube channel</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Tabling</strong></h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter promotes conservative ideas on campus by tabling in support of various topics several times each semester. We typically set up a table on the Diag or in Mason Hall to discuss conservative ideas with students. We also take part in YAF's 9/11 Never Forget Memorial each September, where we place 2,977 flags on the Diag to honor those who lost their lives on September 11th.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Social Events</strong>&nbsp;</h4>\r\n<p>Our chapter also hosts social events to have fun together as a chapter. We typically hang out several times each semester to play paintball, walk around the Arb, go ice skating at Yost, or enjoy a bonfire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conferences</strong></p>\r\n<p>Members from our chapter typically attend several YAF conferences throughout the year. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yafumich.com/yaf.org/events\">yaf.org/events&nbsp;</a>for more information</p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<div class=\"x_x_text-content\">\r\n<h3><strong>The Sharon Statement</strong></h3>\r\n<p>In this time of moral and political crises, it is the responsibility of the youth of America to affirm certain eternal truths.</p>\r\n<p>We, as young conservatives, believe:</p>\r\n<p>That foremost among the transcendent values is the individual&rsquo;s use of his God-given free will, whence derives his right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force;</p>\r\n<p>That liberty is indivisible, and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom;</p>\r\n<p>That the purpose of government is to protect those freedoms through the preservation of internal order, the provision of national defense, and the administration of justice;</p>\r\n<p>That when government ventures beyond these rightful functions, it accumulates power, which tends to diminish order and liberty;</p>\r\n<p>That the Constitution of the United States is the best arrangement yet devised for empowering government to fulfill its proper role, while restraining it from the concentration and abuse of power;</p>\r\n<p>That the genius of the Constitution&mdash;the division of powers&mdash;is summed up in the clause that reserves primacy to the several states, or to the people, in those spheres not specifically delegated to the Federal government;</p>\r\n<p>That the market economy, allocating resources by the free play of supply and demand, is the single economic system compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government, and that it is at the same time the most productive supplier of human needs;</p>\r\n<p>That when government interferes with the work of the market economy, it tends to reduce the moral and physical strength of the nation; that when it takes from one man to bestow on another, it diminishes the incentive of the first, the integrity of the second, and the moral autonomy of both;</p>\r\n<p>That we will be free only so long as the national sovereignty of the United States is secure; that history shows periods of freedom are rare, and can exist only when free citizens concertedly defend their rights against all enemies;</p>\r\n<p>That the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these liberties;</p>\r\n<p>That the United States should stress victory over, rather than coexistence with, this menace; and</p>\r\n<p>That American foreign policy must be judged by this criterion: does it serve the just interests of the United States.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",
